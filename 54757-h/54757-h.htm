<h2 class="main">PRELIMINARY CHAPTER.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mutability is the appropriate motto of humanity; for
what are men but creatures of a day; monarchs, but transient shadows of
earthly greatness; empires, but passing events? Time, with more than
eagle swiftness, hurls all things into the great bosom of Eternity.
Futurity is dark and impenetrable, but the present is with us, and
still more the past, teeming with vast records of human life, of rising
and falling empires, bloody tales of extinguished armies and extirpated
races of mankind, detailing the effects of the wild ambition of kings,
emperors, sultans, themselves but atoms, yet involving the whole mass
in their career.</p>
<p><i>Contrast</i> is often the greatest source of pleasure to the
mind; therefore do the citizens of this New World delight to revel in
the scenes of the olden <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href=
"#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>hemisphere, which was in full glory
when this vast continent lay in undiscovered obscurity.</p>
<p><i>Orientalism!</i> Talisman to conjure up the shades of the very
parents of our race, and of the old patriarchs of Israel, to array in
picturesque and savage beauty the vision of Arabian horsemen, flying
steeds, vast encampments on arid plains, tribes of wandering Tartars,
and almost to awaken the echoes of the clashing and blood-stained
scimitars of the desperate champions of the Crescent, the followers of
the Prophet. And while there is a wall of iron between us and our
future, the eventful record of by-gone times displays to us the
development of all that was hidden to our ancestors.</p>
<p>There is a great difference between the primitive condition of the
human race and the effects which Time has produced upon that wonderful
structure, <span class="sc">MAN</span>!</p>
<p>Simplicity, almost childlike, seems to characterize the living mind
of man in its embryo state, while years of successive re-conceptions
have continued to develop this noble emanation from the great spirit of
the universe.</p>
<p>But how deeply interesting to us, who are the embodiment of the more
mature and experienced human wisdom, to look into the vast womb of the
Past, and trace the growth of the great human f&oelig;tus. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span></p>
<p>The impress of the original condition of our race is yet upon the
nations of the East, and wonderfully do they still retain the habits
and ideas of the earliest ages.</p>
<p>How vividly are the scenes of Biblical record exemplified in the
every-day habits of the people, who, at the present time, dwell in
those venerated countries. The patriarchal family government, the
flowing robes, even the very style of garment of which it is
recorded&mdash;&ldquo;They parted my raiment, and upon my vesture they
cast lots,&rdquo; are one and all in daily use in the East.</p>
<p>Our attention is peculiarly directed to the history of former ages,
and the progress of different empires, by the events which mark the
present course of time&mdash;for the great theme of the day is the Past
and Future of Turkey, the very garden of the East, and the desired of
all nations, upon whose shores has lately been poured the life-blood of
thousands of valiant heroes, each and all members of the vast human
family, whether known to us as Turks, Russians, English, or French.</p>
<p>There is an indefinable charm about all that relates to this land of
the Orient. The position by nature, the variety of scenery, hill,
valley, and undulating plain; the great streams which water its shores,
and the rich productions of the soil, the ancient capital <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name="pb12">12</a>]</span>proudly
towering from its verdant hills, the key to two continents, with the
&ldquo;Ocean stream&rdquo; for a highway. The lovers of classic lore
delight to realize the existence of ancient heroes, and the very homes
of the demigods, as they tread its honored shores. Romance seems to be
merged in reality, as the robed and turbaned Moslem, with stately step
and meditative countenance, passes beneath your latticed casement; or
the veiled lady and sable eunuch, with mysterious silence, stealthily
glide along. Sultans, vezirs, pashas, grand muftis, sultanas, harems,
and slaves, intriguing ulema and judges, so long enveloped in the mist
of fancy, are, in modern days, to emerge into the sunlight of truth and
civilization, and exhibit to the study of philanthropy, only the type
of ancient usages and the actual scenes of <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e656" title="Source: every day">everyday</span> life. Amid the
votaries to superstition and fanaticism, side by side with the banner
of the Cross, the followers of the Prophet, with the Crescent of the
faithful, will, henceforth, march through time into eternity, but known
and read of all men. The door to the East stands open, and we may pass
within the portal to study men and manners, with their institutions,
both social and political.</p>
<p>Many attempts have been made to portray the actual and past
condition of this Oriental empire, and as various have been the lights
and shadows in which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13"
name="pb13">13</a>]</span>it has been pictured; some making the Osmanli
a paragon of humanity, and others again reducing him to a mere polypus
on legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If those who are resident among us,&rdquo; observes the
editor of the &ldquo;New York Herald,&rdquo; &ldquo;cannot, after the
lapse of years, always succeed in identifying themselves with our
ideas, it is not to be expected that writers at a distance, should be
able to form a fair estimate of American society from such imperfect
evidences as they have before them. We have seen how few foreign
tourists have penetrated below the surface of things in their analysis
of our social and political life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If these strictures of the &ldquo;Herald&rdquo; are just and true
with reference to American and European countries in general, where
there is such similarity, how much more applicable to our Oriental
clime; for, considering the peculiar form of government, and
construction of society in Turkey, based, as they are, upon the Koran,
traditional customs, and Oriental conventionalities, hitherto so
inaccessible as well as incomprehensible to strangers, it is, indeed,
no matter of wonder that such heterogeneous portraits of Eastern men
and manners have been promulgated to the world by travellers and
bibliomanists.</p>
<p>Language is the great vehicle of ideas, the bond of man with man,
the &ldquo;open sesame&rdquo; to the spirit <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>of every
community&mdash;the record of the past, the exponent of the present,
and the foreteller of the future. But how few, even of modern savans,
have acquired a knowledge of the Oriental dialects, which are never
used in Europe, and only called into exercise by researches into
ancient chronicles. Even many who have long resided in the East, and
whose daily and hourly contact with the inhabitants would seem to
demand a mutual understanding, have lived and died in a stoical
adherence to their own mother tongues.</p>
<p>A French merchant, Mons. B., who had enjoyed the advantages of
commerce in the East for twenty-five years, may be quoted as an
example. Either considering his own superior civilization compromised
by such a condescension to barbarism, or unable to train his
exclusively French organs to any other guise of speech, Mons.
B.&rsquo;s ideas and expressions were always in his mother tongue.
When, therefore, on a certain occasion, his Turkish porter excited his
displeasure, he poured out his indignation in pure Gallic, which lost
much of its intended effect upon his employ&eacute;, who could not
imagine the cause of his master&rsquo;s agitation and vehemence, and
ventured to ask an explanation of a bystander. &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said
the irritated Frenchman, &ldquo;does the stupid fellow mean to say that
having been with me for the past <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15"
href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>five-and-twenty years, he does
not yet understand French?&rdquo; &ldquo;Mashallah!&rdquo; responded
the astonished Turk, &ldquo;My master, who has been here so long a
time, why can he not scold me in Turkish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emergencies are constantly occurring, and as interpreters cannot be
omnipresent, ridiculous misunderstandings are often the results.</p>
<p>The complacent French and English seem to think their respective
languages universal, and upon their arrival in the East, address the
people accordingly, who can only look and listen, and strain their
senses for one familiar word or phrase; sometimes the simplest
expression, through some euphonious resemblance, may convey an opposite
meaning, or even a flattering compliment be mistaken for a victimizing
oath.</p>
<p>A party of French naval officers, one day visited the shoe bazaar,
and were attracted by the beauty of the collection of a certain
merchant. The author happening to be present, officiated as interpreter
for them, and advised the merchant to display all his best specimens of
embroidered slippers, so that the gentlemen soon had an innumerable
variety before them. But one of them yet unsatisfied, with a spirit of
independence, took a slipper in his hand, and showing it to the
merchant, said, &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Beaucoup mieux, beaucoup mieux,
Efendi.</span>&rdquo; The grave merchant <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>instead of replying,
turned all of a sudden pale with rage, and gathering up his embroidered
wares, mercilessly consigned them to the recesses of his shop, and
bestowing upon these insolent giavours a most genuine Turkish
benediction, ordered them to quit his premises instanter. Bewildered at
the singular conduct of the merchant, I inquired as to the cause of his
sudden irritation. &ldquo;What! did you not hear the impudent rascal
say, <i lang="tr">bokoumu-y&eacute;</i>?&rdquo; said the enraged Turk;
an expression too unfit for ears polite to be translated into English,
though sometimes heard in the purlieus of the Five Points. I attempted
to explain, but in vain; the Turkish was unmistakable, so thought the
shoe-merchant, who insisted that they had at least learned that much of
the language of the country.</p>
<p>Thus, with entire ignorance of the language, thoroughly impregnated
with the prejudices of a European education, the foreigner looks only
upon the surface of things, and comprehends nothing, where the simplest
habits of life and etiquette are diametrically opposed to his
preconceived ideas.</p>
<p>The Osmanli would stare with astonishment at the presumption with
which a Frank uncovered his head in his august presence; while the
exquisite of the <i lang="fr">beau-monde</i> would be lost in wonder to
see his Oriental rival enter his presence <i>without</i> shoes, and
seat himself <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>on the sofa with his feet carefully concealed
beneath him; thus only conforming to the ancient etiquettes of the
Bible, for Moses was not commanded to uncover his head, but to put off
his shoes. At least, some of the Oriental forms of politeness have
antiquity as their origin, and the sanction of many generations; but
for the varying code of western manners, where can we look, save to the
capricious tastes of the passing times.</p>
<p>Thus are the simplest habits of life reversed, and what is excessive
rudeness to the one, may be the essence of politeness to the other.
Very frequently these contrary customs are the source of ludicrous
mistakes.</p>
<p>As we were walking one day with a friend, a sailor from the English
fleet accidentally dropped his pocket-handkerchief. The gentleman
regretting that the worthy tar should meet with such a loss, hailed
him, at the same time beckoning with his hand <i lang="fr">&agrave; la
Turque</i>, which is done by extending the arm and moving the fingers
with the palm downwards, or just in the same manner as would here be
done to imply a more distant removal.</p>
<p>A police officer happening to be at no great distance, the sailor,
on looking back, understood quite naturally my friend&rsquo;s movement
as a signal for him to make his escape, and accordingly took to his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>heels with the greatest rapidity, leaving my
companion in utter amazement. I endeavored to explain to him the reason
of the sailor&rsquo;s conduct, by showing him the genuine European
style of beckoning, by reversing the hand and moving the up-turned
forefinger back and forth. This astonished him the more, since that
motion is equivalent, in Turkey, to that comical American gesture of
placing the thumb on the tip end of the nose, and extending the
fingers.</p>
<p>Thus things which are in themselves trifles, may lead or mislead to
mighty results, and can only be appreciated when circumstances call
them into action. Therefore nothing but actual nativity and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name=
"pb19">19</a>]</span>education among the people, with the enlarged
views which are acquired by a residence in European countries, can
enable an individual to judge and appreciate the peculiar institutions
of Turkey.</p>
<p>The author presents himself to the American public a native of
Constantinople, and of Armenian parentage, with the hope that he may be
able to unfold some new phases of Turkey and Orientalism, which may
tend to remove any unfounded prejudices, and enlighten their minds with
regard to the real and existing state of his country.</p>
<p>In order to attain a just and correct idea of the present state of
Turkey and its probable future, it is most essential to take a cursory
glance at the origin of the nation, its religion, government, civil
laws, social condition, and domestic relations, which are the elements
of nationality. In so doing, the writer has carefully avoided all
partiality, and endeavored to display the truth, simply, and nothing
but the truth, invested with the garb of a peculiar nationality, and
only adorned with the poetry of Oriental tastes and habits as they
actually exist. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Turkish and Eastern proverbs have often a deep and
significative meaning under a simple simile. They say, &ldquo;a
neighbor&rsquo;s chicken has always so unreal a magnitude in covetous
eyes, that it swells in its proportions even to the size of a
goose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Human nature has in reality undergone but few changes since it
descended upon this planet. The simplest shepherds and the richest
sovereigns have been alike swayed by the demon of envy. The earth no
sooner became the inheritance of man, than its treasures excited the
desire of appropriation in his breast. Mine and thine were the earliest
appellatives between man and his brother.</p>
<p>All-bountiful Nature provided a perpetual feast to their physical
wants, in her luxuriant offerings, ready for use, without toil or
labor. The flocks of the early pastoral days wandered from field to
field, along with their shepherd kings. Ample was the territory as they
forsook the soil when winter chilled, and roamed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>to
summer climes exempt from care. Simple in their tastes, they grew and
multiplied until they became mighty nations. But the monarchs of the
animal world, the kings of the forests, could not brook any inroads
upon their dominions, and self-defence awoke man&rsquo;s ingenuity, and
armed him with the war-club, the unerring stone and sling, the
quivering arrow, and pointed javelin. The practised hand, thus trained
in vanquishing the roaring lion, easily turned against his neighbor
man, and the stronger prevailed in the usurpation of coveted
territories.</p>
<p>Thus war, in the absence of the arts of modern civilization became
the sole aim of these wandering tribes. Alliances were sometimes formed
for mutual protection, and territories were ever changing masters. The
primitive belief that the soil was common property, and that occupancy
gave the only title to possession, induced them to trespass upon the
neighboring territories. This same principle exists even at this
present day among some of the people of the East, of whom the tribe of
Y&uuml;r&uuml;cks is well known in Turkey, traversing the whole
dominion of Asia Minor, according to the climate they desire to
find.</p>
<p>Passing by the days of Biblical History and the ancient pedigree of
the Arabians, we will observe the first appearance of the Turks on the
pages of history. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22"
name="pb22">22</a>]</span></p>
<p>As early as the ninth century, a small but adventurous band of
Scythians, known as the Turkomans, impelled either by famine or
hostility, crossed the Caspian Mountains, and invaded the Armenian
territories.</p>
<p>Although they were bravely repulsed, still the prosperous condition
of the country was too alluring for them to give up all hope of its
ultimate conquest, they therefore continued to harass the inhabitants
by their incessant incursions.</p>
<p>In the middle of the eleventh century, a vigorous attempt was made,
under the command of Toghrul Bey, a grandson of Seljuk, one of the
principal families of Tartary, with an army of one hundred thousand
men, who ravaged twenty-four of its provinces.</p>
<p>Toghrul, already so distinguished by his valor, now embraced
Islamism, and thus added to the thirst of conquest, the ardor of the
religion of the Prophet. Another more desperate sally was made with
redoubled force, which met with <span class="corr" id="xd25e752" title=
"Source: similiar">similar</span> discomfiture.</p>
<p>Fourteen years after, the infuriated Tartars collecting an army of
no less than three hundred thousand men, renewed their assaults.</p>
<p>Armenia was at this time not only harassed on all sides by Greeks,
Saracens, and Persians, but rent by the internal dissensions of its own
princes; so that it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23"
name="pb23">23</a>]</span>now fell a prey to Toghrul, who massacred, in
cold blood, 140,000 of the inhabitants, carrying many also into
captivity.</p>
<p>The most flourishing provinces in due time were added to the
conquests of the Turkomans, by Alf-arslan the nephew and successor of
Toghrul. Their empire was greatly extended by the son of Alf-arslan,
Melik-Shah, and was subsequently divided among three branches of the
house of Seljuk. Suleyman, the third in descent from Melik-Shah, was
the first Turkoman prince who governed Asia Minor.</p>
<p>Er-Toghrul, or Orthogrul, the son of Suleyman, having by his
assistance on a certain occasion, secured a victory to Ali-ed-din, the
sultan of Babylon, Kara-Hissar in Bithynia, was bestowed upon him, and
there he settled with his family, which consisted of three sons. Osman,
the eldest son and successor of his father, Orthogrul, was left by the
death of Ali-ed-din, the ally of his father, without a rival in the
government of Syria; he was accordingly proclaimed sultan.</p>
<p>In the year 1,300 he made Neapolis the capital of his dominions, and
from thence is dated the foundation of the present Ottoman empire.</p>
<p>Osman was so distinguished by his conquests, and became so endeared
to his subjects, that ever since his time, the appellation of Osmanlis
has been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>adopted by them; and the word <i>T&uuml;rk</i>, or
Turk, so indiscriminately applied to them by the Europeans, is not only
inappropriate, but of a disagreeable signification, for it is only used
among themselves as an epithet of opprobrium.</p>
<p>In the twenty-sixth year of his reign, Osman took the city of
Broossa, in Asia Minor, which his son Orkhan, who succeeded him, made
the capital of his dominions. The desire, however, to possess the city
of Stamboul, was transferred with increasing ardor from sultan to
sultan; but the glory of its conquest was reserved for Mohammed II.</p>
<p>The effeminate condition of the Greeks favored his design; for out
of a population of 200,000 men, there were scarcely 8,000 ready to
defend their capital; and on the 29th of May, 1453, Constantinople fell
into the hands of the Osmanlis, or descendants of Osman, who have held
it in possession until the present day.</p>
<p>It is evident that the Osmanlis are the descendants of the
Scythians, or one of the Tartar tribes; but who those Scythians
originally were, may be questioned.</p>
<p>A very curious, but plausible theory is advanced by some persons,
that the Tartars are of the Jewish race. Tarat-har or Tartar, in the
Syrian language, signifies the <i>remnant of a people</i>. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now, in the second book of Kings, it is recorded that the King of
Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed
them in Halah and Habor, by the river of Gozan in the cities of the
Medes. This was about 720 years before Christ.</p>
<p>Medea is situated near the Caspian Sea; possessed entirely by these
Tartars.</p>
<p>The names which are given to their principal cities, are the same as
were common among the Jews. For instance, the capital of Tartary is
called Semerkand; which is a corruption of Samaryan, very similar to
Samaria. There are, moreover, many relics of antiquity in this city,
which bear undeniable evidences of having been Jewish monuments. They
have also another town called Jericho, a Mount Sion and a Mount Tabor,
with a river Yordon or Jordan.</p>
<p>They are divided into <i>ten tribes</i>, bearing names similar to
the ancient patriarchs of Israel.</p>
<p>They are under one government, but avoid all intermarriages; which
was also a peculiar observance of the Jews. There is also a great
similarity between the Tartar and the Hebrew languages. The degeneracy
of their language, may be attributed to the fact, that they were long
captives in a strange land, and removed from all intercourse with more
enlightened nations.</p>
<p>The Tartars have <span class="corr" id="xd25e803" title=
"Source: ever">even</span> been known to observe the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>Jewish
rites of worship and circumcision, and they traditionally boast
themselves to be descended from those Israelites, who, conquering their
conquerors, became possessed of all the territories by the Caspian Sea.
Indeed, Timour-link or Tamerlane the Great, is said to have proudly
asserted, that he was descended in a direct line from the tribe of
Dan.</p>
<p>From these facts, it seems very probable that the people known as
the Tartars, are the ten lost tribes of the Jews; and it is
historically certain, that the founders of the present Turkish Empire,
are descendants of these Tartars. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27"

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h2 class="main">RELIGION.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Five hundred and sixty-nine years after Christ,
Mohammed the prophet was born at Mecca, where his immediate ancestors
had for many years enjoyed a sort of regal and priestly authority over
the Caaba or Temple of the Arabians, which, for at least seven hundred
years, had been the shrine of adoration for the worshippers of the sun,
moon, and stars.</p>
<p>His family was considered the most illustrious, among the tribes of
the Arabs, so that he was born to distinction.</p>
<p>The early loss of his parents left him an orphan, under the care of
his uncle Abu-Taleb, who paid little attention to his nephew.</p>
<p>At the early age of twelve years, he was initiated into the
mysteries of Eastern commerce, as he journeyed with his uncle through
Syria, to Bassora and Damascus. But the contemplative mind of this
youth, destined to become the Prophet of his country, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>gathered
into its fructifying soil the tenets of the religious faith of the
Christians, which were more congenial to his spirit than the idolatries
of his own people.</p>
<p>The Arabs too, were anticipating the birth of a Messiah of their
own, who was to descend from the sacred guardians of the Caaba; so that
circumstances seemed to point out to the precocious youth, this road to
greatness.</p>
<p>Well born, of insinuating manners and graceful address, noble and
majestic in appearance, Mohammed became the object of affection to the
wealthy widow Khatijeh, who married him, and thus riches were added to
his facilities.</p>
<p>The great crowd of pilgrims who assembled in Mecca, afforded the
Prophet constant occasions for the discussion of various systems of
religious faith, until Mohammed resolved to announce himself as the
completion of the revelation of God to the Jews and
Christians&mdash;the predicted by Moses and Christ, who coming after
them, should be the greatest of all the prophets.</p>
<p>To the idolatrous Arabs he proclaimed one God, omnipotent and
imperishable; to the Christians he revived the unity of their Maker,
and recalled to the Jews the Jehovah, whose worship they had so
corrupted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span></p>
<p>The confusion of the Asiatic states, rent with wars, tumults and
heresies, wonderfully favored the spread of Mohammedanism, even beyond
the warmest anticipations of the Prophet.</p>
<p>Arming himself with the sword, and promising the joys of paradise to
every soldier of the Crescent who should die on the battle-field, he
led on this wonderful prodigy of a religious faith, conquering and to
conquer.</p>
<p>At this day there are no less than 200,550,000 Mahommedans! The
Koran, or <i>the written</i>, is the compendium of the faith, practice
and civil laws of Mussulmans, ingeniously compiled by their great
Arabian Prophet, and is styled by the Faithful, The Light of God, Sole
Guide to Paradise, Divine Director to Heavenly Glories, and in common
parlance, The Eternal Word&mdash;<i>Kelamu-Kadim</i>. They acknowledge
the divine origin of the Pentateuch, the Psalms of David, and the four
Gospels, and upon these books, with the Koran, their oaths are
taken.</p>
<p>The Koran declares, &ldquo;Verily the true religion in the sight of
God is Islam,&rdquo; which is the proper name of the Mohammedan faith,
and it signifies resignation or submission to the service and commands
of God. It consists of two principles, <i>Iman</i>, or Faith, and
<i>Din</i><span class="corr" id="xd25e856" title="Source: .">,</span>
Religion or Practice. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30"

<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">IMAN OR FAITH.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The great article of Faith is called <i>Salavat</i>,
and is expressed in these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;La-Illah, Ill-Allah, Mohammed Ressoul-Ullah.&rdquo; There is
no God, but God, and <span class="corr" id="xd25e871" title=
"Source: Mahommed">Mohammed</span> is the Apostle of God.</p>
<p>They deny the doctrine of the Trinity, although they acknowledge the
attributes of God, his greatness, goodness, justice, omnipresence,
omniscience, and incomprehensibility. Christ is acknowledged to have
been a prophet greater than Moses, but inferior to Mohammed. He is
styled the Word of God, <i>Kelam-Ullah</i>, in their writings, supposed
to have been miraculously conceived by the Virgin Mary, but not of
divine origin. The crucifixion they regard as inconsistent with the
justice of God; to yield up so mighty a prophet, endowed with power to
work miracles, and raise the dead, a victim to the unbelieving Jews,
they deem incompatible with divine supremacy, and even say, that when
Christ was led out to die, he was, invisibly to his persecutors,
transported into heaven, Judas the betrayer being substituted in his
stead. No terrors of <i>eternal</i> punishment in a future state
distract the unfaithful Moslems, all of whom will, in due time, expiate
their offences and be admitted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31"
href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>to happiness. Two angels are
supposed to attend them through life and in death. One white, glorious
and commiserate; the other black, severe, and cruel.</p>
<p>There will also be a last judgment, when a tremendous trumpet will
shake the earth to atoms. God will judge all men. Moses, Christ, and
Mohammed, will appear at the head of their respective followers, as
intercessors. And Cain will lead the immense multitude of the damned,
who are doomed to suffer till their sins are cancelled, when they will
take their seats in Paradise; while Hell, the Devil, and his wicked
angels, will be suddenly annihilated.</p>
<p>A narrow bridge, fine as a hair, called <i>Surat</i>, lies over the
region of the damned. The righteous, upheld by their guardian angels,
pass over safely; while the guilty fall down into awful flames and
torture, doomed to quaff nothing but &ldquo;boiling water, until their
bowels burst.<span class="corr" id="xd25e891" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Paradise is above the seventh heaven, near the throne of God. A vast
and beautiful region, with palaces of gold and gardens of perpetual
delight, in the midst of which is the tree of happiness, Tuba, whose
roots are in the palace of the Prophet, but whose branches, loaded with
luscious fruits and all kinds of meats prepared for food, silken robes
and caparisoned steeds, will extend to the dwelling of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>every
true believer. Softly murmuring fountains, cooling shades and grottoes,
mountains of sparkling diamonds, and golden trees, will adorn the
gardens of delight, while the ravishing houris of these enchanting
regions, will be blessed with perpetual youth and virginity.</p>
<p>The most insignificant of the Faithful will have a retinue of 80,000
servants and 72 wives, of the sweetly odoriferous damsels, created of
pure musk, in addition to the companions of his earthly sojourn.
Delicious streams of wine, milk, and honey, will flow on perpetually;
balmy zephyrs will pervade the atmosphere; the very physical excretions
of the true believers will be but odoriferous exhalations.</p>
<p>While the senses are thus ravished with delights, the most excelling
of all their beatific visions will be the presence of Allah, which is
beyond the power of language to describe.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Fatalism</span> is a characteristic item in the
Mohammedan creed.</p>
<p>They believe that whatever happens is pre-ordained by the
Omniscient, which article of faith is designated <i>Kader</i> or
predestination. But the doctrine of &ldquo;free-agency&rdquo; the
<i>Iradeyi-J&uuml;seey&eacute;</i> or the &ldquo;lesser will,&rdquo; is
also in their creed. Hence every one is bound to exert himself to his
utmost; and it is only when he fails, that he resigns himself calmly
and philosophically <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34"
name="pb34">34</a>]</span>to his disappointment, saying <i>kader</i>,
or it is my fate.</p>
<p>The following legend may perhaps serve to illustrate the spirit of
Oriental Fatalism:</p>
<p>Half-way across the Bosphorus, and between Seraglio Point and
Scutari, in Asia, is the renowned Kiz-Koulessi, or the Maiden&rsquo;s
Tower. It was predicted that the beautiful daughter of a certain sultan
would meet with an early death, from the bite of a serpent. Contrary to
prediction, her father hoped to avert her fate, by placing her in a
situation inaccessible to those reptiles. As he revolved the subject in
his mind, from the windows of the Seraglio, his eye rested on the rock
in the stream, where he immediately ordered a tower to be erected, and
thither the unhappy princess was conveyed and immured in her island
home.</p>
<p>But who can resist the decrees of Fate?</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="tr" class="lg">
<p class="line">Bin djahd etsen na-murad&eacute;</p>
<p class="line">Olmaz moukadderden ziyad&eacute;.</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">You may do your utmost,</p>
<p class="line">But you cannot conquer Fate.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">Scutari, fruitful in vineyards, and far-famed for its
delicious grapes, was destined to furnish the venom, which poisoned the
crimson tide in the veins of the beautiful sultana; for a basket of
Scutari grapes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>concealed the viper, which was the instrument in
the hand of Fate, and the fulfillment of the prophecy.</p>
<p>It is, doubtless, in the recollection of many of the citizens of New
York, that a short time ago an individual passing by Wallack&rsquo;s
Theatre was suddenly killed by the falling of the flag-staff from the
top of the building. This sad occurrence was not the result of
carelessness or temerity, but purely accidental; and would also be
termed in Turkey <i>kaza</i> or accident. Yet why the accident should
have happened to this individual more than to any other of the hundreds
of persons who passed the same spot&mdash;Mohammedan doctrine would
simply answer, &ldquo;it was his <i>kader</i> or predestination.&rdquo;
To mourn, therefore, for the dead, or complain against misfortune,
would by them be esteemed a grievous sin, as though censuring the
Almighty, without whose knowledge &ldquo;not a sparrow falleth to the
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is not Fatalism that makes the Mohammedan indifferent to
casualties, but his exaggerated and misconceived ideas of his religious
obligations; for human imperfectibility is as prominent an article of
their creed as Fatalism, and even induces a disposition to avoid
self-improvement either intellectually or externally. Perfection being
the attribute of the Deity, it is unbecoming in his creatures to
assert, in any form whatever, their capabilities of approximation
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>to such a condition. While, then, their minds
repose in the simplicity of innate ideas, they even seek imperfection
in the investiture of their bodies. They will rend their garments so as
to mar their completeness, assume an air of general slovenliness, or
studiously clip the corner of a sheet of paper to destroy its regular
uniformity.</p>
<p>It is, then, most erroneous to suppose that the doctrine of Fatalism
is so antagonistic to civilization in the East, as it implies
resignation to the Divine will, and by no means impedes active personal
exertion. But in reality it is the seeming propriety of human
imperfection, in contradistinction to the Divine excellence, which has
hitherto maintained a spirit of indifference to progressive
improvement. While an entire submission to the course of events, as
preordained and predestined by the Omniscient, prevents all restless
anxiety, and calms the repinings of the heart-broken and weary, this
more truly fatal and false notion of inferiority, only leaves the
immortal mind in a sort of embryo state, lest, perchance, there should
be any assimilation to the great Supreme Essence, from which it is but
an emanation, or the spark should glow with the brightness of the fire
from which it has been wafted. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37"

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">SECTARIANISM.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Besides the Koran, there are other sacred and
traditional books called the <i>Sonnah</i>, the productions of
Abubekir, Omer, and Osman, the successors of the Prophet. The ancient
caliphs of Egypt and Babylon have also added their own. These books
have numerous commentaries upon them, which constitute the principal
part of the Mohammedan literature, and have been the source of much
dissension. Sectarianism, therefore, prevails among the Mussulmans as
in every part of the world. We will only mention those sects with whom
the traveller in the East is apt to come in contact.</p>
<p>The principal schism which divides the Mohammedan nation is that of
the S&uuml;nnees and the Sheyees.</p>
<p>The S&uuml;nnees are the orthodox party, and believe in the
traditions attributed to the Prophet and his successors, and are strict
in all their observances. Whereas the Sheyees reject all traditions and
are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>strict legitimists, adhering to Aali, who married
the Prophet&rsquo;s daughter, as the rightful successor, and rendering
their homage to his descendants.</p>
<p>The Turks are all S&uuml;nnees, and the Persians Sheyees, the one is
more fanatical, the other more superstitious, and as the difference
between them is small, so is their mutual hatred proportionably
intense.</p>
<p>The S&uuml;nnees repudiate Aali, the infallible director of the
Sheyees, who, in their turn, decapitate the representatives
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>of the Prophet, Abubekir, Omer, and Osman in
effigy. For they erect these persons in sugar at their festivals, and
when merry over their wine, cut the respected friends of Mohammed into
pieces and actually drink them in solution.</p>
<p>The Turks elevate the sacred color, green, to their heads and
turbans with the greatest respect, but in contradistinction, the
Persians choose this hue for their shoes, trowsers, and every other
disrespectful use their ingenuity can devise. When the one shaves, the
other does not, and scorns the thorough ablutions of his rival. Indeed
no matter how or what, so it be <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>.</p>
<p>Most ingenious and vituperative are their mutual curses. &ldquo;May
your fatigued and hated soul, when damned to <i>Berzak</i> (purgatory),
find no more rest than a Giavour&rsquo;s hat enjoys upon earth.&rdquo;
Doubtless alluding to the peculiar custom of the Franks in uncovering
their head in saluting, and the wear and tear that head-gear has to
undergo. &ldquo;May your transmuted soul become in hell a hackney ass,
for the Jews themselves to ride about on,&rdquo; and many such emphatic
compliments are the height of fashion among the zealous adherents of
each adverse party.</p>
<p>Not only in the West, but in the East,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis strange there should such difference
be,</p>
<p class="line">&rsquo;Twixt tweedledum and tweedledee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span></p>
<p>Apart from the foregoing, the very meaning of the word Islam, or
resignation to the service and commands of God, has been a source of
much dissertation and dissension, and has produced a variety of sects,
of which the Hanefees, Mevlevees, Rifayees, and Abdals, are the most
noted in Turkey. The Hanefees are the contemplative philosophers,
Oriental spiritualists or transcendentalists; and to this class the
sultan and the principal part of the people belong. The Mevlevees are
the dancing or whirling dervishes, and they may therefore be considered
as the Oriental Shakers. Their object is practical resignation to God,
which state of mind they think they attain, by whirling round and round
until their senses are lost in the dizzy motion.</p>
<p>They conform to the general tenets and observances, but their form
of worship is peculiar.</p>
<p>Their religious edifices are called <i>Tekk&eacute;s</i>, which are
open every Tuesday and Friday, and are frequently visited by the sultan
and Europeans in general.</p>
<p>A large square space, which is surrounded by a circular railing,
constitutes the scene of their ritual, or ceremonies. A gallery
occupies three sides of the building, in which is the latticed
apartment of the sultan, and the place for the Turkish ladies.</p>
<p>In every mosque, and here also, there is a niche <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>opposite
the entrance, called the <i>Mihrab</i>, which indicates the direction
of Mecca. The walls are adorned with entablatures, ornamented with
verses from the Koran, and with ciphers of sultans, and mottos in
memory of other benevolent individuals, who have endowed the
Tekk&eacute;.</p>
<p>The Sheikh, or leader of the community, sits in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>front of
the <i>Mihrab</i>, on an Angora goat-skin, or a carpet, attended by two
of his disciples.</p>
<p>An attenuated old man, with a visage furrowed and withered by time,
bronzed by many successive suns, his long and grizzly beard witnessing
to the ravages of age, while his prominent eyes sparkling like
lightnings amid the surrounding darkness, are the only symbols of
animation or life, in his worn-out frame.</p>
<p>The dervishes, as they enter, make a low obeisance with folded hands
to this patron saint, with an air of mystic veneration, and take their
stand with their faces towards Mecca. The old sheikh arises, and
presiding over the assembly commences the services.</p>
<p>Their peculiar head-gear, called <i>sikk&eacute;</i>, of thick brown
felt, in the shape of a sugar loaf, and long and flowing robes of
varied hues, make them seem like fantastic representations of some
other sphere, particularly, when they commence the slow and measured
prostrations of Mussulman worship.</p>
<p>Prayers being over, each dervish doffs his mantle, and appears in a
long white fustanella, trailing the polished floor, and of innumerable
folds, with a tightly fitting vest of the same pure color.</p>
<p>They now defile two by two before the sheikh, who extending his hand
towards them, seems to diffuse a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43"
href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>sort of magnetism, which
irradiates every countenance.</p>
<p>As they stand immovable, the wild and thrilling music slowly
pervades every sense, until suddenly one of the number extends his
arms, and begins to revolve noiselessly, with slow and measured step.
The folds of his ample skirt now gradually open like the wings of a
bird, and with the swiftness of his motion, expand, until the dervish
only appears like the centre of a whirlwind. The rest are all alike in
motion, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name=
"pb44">44</a>]</span>arms extended, eyes half closed as in a dream, the
head inclined on one side, they move round and round to the measured
time of the music, as if floating in ecstasy.</p>
<p>The calm and unimpassioned chief, with slow and stealthy step,
wanders among their evolutions. Suddenly they cease, and march around
the circle. The music increases its measure, and the dervishes again
commence their giddy motions; old and young seem to be in a visionary
rhapsody. Perhaps transported in the bewildering whirl to the regions
of the blest, they languish with rapture in the arms of the houris of
Paradise; or lose their earthly senses amid the glories which surround
the throne of Allah; till suddenly they stand transfixed, their
outspread and snowy drapery folding around them like the marble
investment of an antique statue.</p>
<p>They are all prostrated, exhausted by their ecstasies, and
immovable, until the sheikh recalls them to the realities of time by
his holy benediction, when they slowly rise again, compass the
building, and enveloping themselves with their cast-off mantles,
silently disappear. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45"

<h3 class="main">HOWLING DERVISHES.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is an intoxication in the very motions of the
whirling dervishes, but the horrible ceremonies of the Rifayees are
really distressing to the beholder.</p>
<p>A long, empty hall, much like that of the Inquisition, as its walls
are adorned by an infinite variety <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46"
href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>of instruments of torture,
constitutes their temple of worship.</p>
<p>The fanatical disciples of this sect assemble every Thursday at
their Tekk&eacute;, which is in Scutari, and after the performance of
the usual ritual of the Mussulmans, commence their ceremonies by
ranging themselves along the three sides of the apartment and within
the balustrade, which serves to separate them from the spectators.</p>
<p>Their sheikh takes his stand before the Mihrab facing the assembly,
and three or four of the members furnishing themselves with instruments
of music place themselves in the centre of the hall.</p>
<p>The performance then begins, by a monotonous chant, accompanied with
music, and the waving of their heads to and fro, which seems to create
a sympathetic vertigo in the Mussulman bystanders&mdash;for they often
are irresistibly drawn into the ranks.</p>
<p>By degrees, the motion increases, the chant grows louder, and their
countenances become livid, and their lungs seem to expand with the
noise and excitement.</p>
<p>The line becomes a solid phalanx as they place their arms on each
other&rsquo;s shoulders, and withdrawing a step, suddenly advance with
a tremendous and savage yell, Allah&mdash;Allah&mdash;Allah&mdash;hoo!
which divine appellative is to be repeated a thousand times
uninterruptedly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47" name=
"pb47">47</a>]</span></p>
<p>This strenuous effort renders them perfectly hideous, their very
eyes seem ready to start from their sockets, and their lips foam as the
inspiration possesses them. Thus retreating and springing forward,
they, each time, with increasing energy, renew their invocations of
Allah, Allah, Allah, hoo! until the distinctness of their articulation
is lost, and their exclamation becomes, in reality a complete howl, as
if proceeding from a pack of enraged dogs&mdash;thus meriting the
sobriquet of the &ldquo;Howling Dervishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The movements and cries increase in swiftness until a mist of dust
pervades the dim apartment, and the wild and pale enthusiasts, drenched
with perspiration, seem like fantastic demons in the realms of discord.
Suddenly some of them, stripped to their waists, rush forward and
seizing the poignards and stilettoes, commence a wild, infuriated
dance, jumping, leaping, and lacerating themselves&mdash;fixing the
weapons into the hollow of their cheeks, and twisting them round and
round, as if on pivots, until, exhausted from exertion, they fall to
the ground in a spasmodic fit.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Only to show with how small pain,</p>
<p class="line">The sores of faith are cured again,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Now the enthusiastic mothers approach, and cast their
children before the presiding sheikh, who, as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>they lie
extended before him, deliberately plants his heavy feet upon their
frail bodies, and so stands for some seconds. Old men and maidens, lay
themselves low before this saint, who is supposed to be by this time so
inspired as to have a miraculous power of expressing all ailments and
maladies from the human frame, and to have become so etherealized by
the ecstatic ceremonies as to lose all his specific gravity.</p>
<p>The <i>Abdals</i> include the various classes of the stoics, who
generally pretend to a total renunciation of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>all
worldly comforts. Sometimes clothed in the coarsest garments, and again
half naked, and even with lacerated bodies, they wander through the
Mohammedan dominions, a miserable set of frantic, idle, and conceited
beggars. They may, in fact, be considered the &ldquo;communists&rdquo;
of the East, who despising honest pursuits, live upon the community at
large.</p>
<p>They commit the worst extravagances under the pretence of heavenly
raptures, and are even supposed to be divinely inspired. Idiots and
fools are esteemed by the Mohammedans as the favorites of Heaven; their
spirits are supposed to have deserted their earthly tenements, and to
be holding converse with angels, while their bodies still wander about
the earth.</p>
<p>It would be wearisome to go into further details; for infinite is
the diversity of the orthodox theologies of the Mohammedans, with the
235 articles of the creed, on which all the doctors of divinity differ;
hopeless must be the task of the student to surmount the commentaries
of the 280 canonical authors, not to mention the innumerable heretical
tenets of other sects, which must be studied to be controverted.</p>
<p>Verily we would suggest the recipe of a certain <i>Molla</i>, who
must have given up in dire despair, &ldquo;Whenever you meet with an
infidel, abuse him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50"
name="pb50">50</a>]</span>with all your might, and no one will doubt
you are a staunch believer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As long as war and its exciting scenes occupied the restless minds
of the Arabs, there was no time for religious or party intrigue. The
simple &ldquo;La Illah-Illallah,&rdquo; satisfied the momentary
breathings of their souls heavenward.</p>
<p>The turmoil of their life, the glitter of their arms and dreadful
carnage of all infidels, sufficed to ease their fancy, and satisfy the
thirst for excitement.</p>
<p>It was as they wiped their blood-stained scimitars, and during the
reaction which comparative peace and luxury created, that their minds,
free from more substantial food and activity, sought greater refinement
of spirituality.</p>
<p>In the absence of the real, the speculative began to grow, until
Imams and Ulema found that they could turn the tide of human affairs to
their own advantage, by exciting polemical and theological
controversies.</p>
<p>A comparative study of the niceties of Mussulman doctrine, and
hair-breadth distinctions with those of more refined and enlightened
creeds, while it displays many and striking similarities, only
illustrates, with startling vividness, the time worn maxim, that
&ldquo;there is nothing new under the sun.&rdquo; <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h2 class="main">DIN OR PRACTICE OF RELIGION.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i>Din</i>, or Practice of Religion, comprises
ablution, prayer, alms, fasting, and a pilgrimage to Mecca.</p>
<p><i>Ablution.</i>&mdash;Bathing, and various forms of ablutions, were
practised long before the time of Mohammed; but he has incorporated
cleanliness with his religion, until his followers seem to regard water
as not only possessed of virtue to cleanse the pollutions of their
bodies, but as purifying their souls from the contamination of sin.
Therefore, fountains are always to be found in the neighborhood of all
the mosques, in every part of the city and its suburbs, and on the
highways&mdash;for they never omit this preliminary to their devotions,
which includes washing the face, hands, and feet; and when they happen
to be in the desert, where no water can be obtained, sand is
substituted. Indeed, the same ablutions are so essential, that their
observance is invariably required of the faithful, before the
administration of an oath. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href=
"#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Prayers.</i> Five times a day the Mussulmans are summoned to
prayer by the <i>muezzin</i>.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, just before the sun is above the horizon, the
<i>ezan</i> resounds through the still atmosphere, from the airy
balcony of the tapering <i>Minar&eacute;</i>. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Muezzin, covering his ears with his hands, as if to exclude all
<span class="corr" id="xd25e1183" title=
"Source: terrestial">terrestrial</span> sound, turns his face towards
Mecca, and chants with musical cadence, the beautiful Arabic formula.
<span class="corr" id="xd25e1186" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Allah, ikber! Allah ikber! &amp;c, great
God! great God! there is no God, but God! I attest that Mohammed is the
apostle of God! Oh, Great Redeemer! Oh! Ruler of the universe! great
God! great God! there is no God but God!&rdquo; and he slowly moves
round the balcony, as if addressing the inhabitants of all parts of the
world.</p>
<p>Those who catch the echoes of the holy call, exclaim with solemn
earnestness, &ldquo;There is no power, no strength but in God
Almighty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, when the hour of noon seems to indicate a moment of repose to
the work-day world, the ezan summons all thoughts and aspirations to
the great God. At three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, at sunset, and
finally at nine o&rsquo;clock, the call resounds ere they prepare for
sleep.</p>
<p>How beautiful thus to note the passage of time, to look thus from
earth to heaven, to forget for a moment all worldly cares, and breathe
out a soul aspiration towards a better land.</p>
<p>Those who happen to be near a mosque, enter it for the purpose of
performing their devotions; others are in their own houses; and many
prostrate themselves by the wayside; or even on board the daily
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>steamers. The mosques are always open, and there
is an Imam who presides over the devotions.</p>
<p>The interior of a mosque, is as simple as that of any Protestant
church. The only ornaments seen are the suspended lamps, interspersed
here and there with ostrich eggs. There are no accommodations for
sitting down, and the altar is the niche or <i>mihrab</i>. There is a
small pulpit on one side, from which a sermon is preached every Friday
noon; but the form of prayer is always the same.</p>
<p>As they assemble, they leave their shoes at the door, &ldquo;for the
ground is holy,&rdquo; and seat themselves upon the floor, which is
either covered with carpet or matting.</p>
<p>At the appointed time, the Imam commences the service, by taking his
position before the mihrab; and placing his thumbs behind his ears, as
if with his open palms to shut out all objects of sense, proclaims to
the assembly, &ldquo;Allah-ikber! Allah-ikber!&rdquo; The congregation
rise and imitate the officiating priest. All remain standing with their
hands folded on their bosoms, while the Imam repeats the first chapter
of the Koran&mdash;which is the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer of the Mohammedans,
termed <i>Fatiha</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of the most merciful God; praise be to God, the
Lord of all creatures; the most merciful; the King of the day of
judgment; thee do we worship, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=
"#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>and of thee do we beg assistance;
direct us in the right way, in the way of those to whom thou hast been
gracious; not of those against whom them art incensed, nor of those who
go astray. Amen.<span class="corr" id="xd25e1221" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>They then make a semi-genuflexion, by placing the hands on the
knees, and bending the person forward. A complete genuflexion succeeds,
which is made by bending the knees to the ground, and extending the
arms forward as a support to the body, while the forehead touches the
ground.</p>
<p>These same genuflexions are again repeated; then partially rising
they sit on their bended knees. Here endeth the first lesson, for two
other <span class="corr" id="xd25e1233" title=
"Source: similiar">similar</span> ceremonies are repeated successively,
during which any portion of the Koran may be selected by the
officiating Imam for recitation.</p>
<p>The termination of the service is known when the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span>Imam,
after a few moments of silent meditation, slowly turns his head, first
towards the right and then to the left, in token of salutation to the
two recording angels who are supposed to be hovering over each
shoulder. He then strokes his beard, and rises from his devotions. His
example is followed by the congregation, who immediately disperse.</p>
<p>There is a wonderful air of sacred stillness during the services in
a mosque. The simplest and plainest attire is worn, and everything
excluded which could divert the attention from God and his worship.</p>
<p>No man utters prayers as matters of form, while he stares about to
see how his neighbors&rsquo; clothes are fashioned. No sound of
footsteps or creaking boots is heard, nor opening or shutting of pews.
No cushioned seats invite to listlessness, or even to slumbers; no
<i>ennui</i> steals over their devotional spirits; the world is
literally and practically excluded. No earthly houris tempt their
thoughts from God, with alluring smiles and recognitions; there is no
peeping from behind the prayer books, or fluttering fans, or any other
of the insinuating wiles of coquetry.</p>
<p>Ladies with their sweet eyes turned to heaven, while their rosy lips
are modeled to scorn of their neighbor&rsquo;s want of taste and
fashion, are invisible in the Mohammedan temple.</p>
<p>Here the faithful come to worship God, and they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>wisely
divest the shrine of their devotions of all the trappings of earthly
grandeur, and leave beyond the portal the alluring and sensual
pleasures of earth. The presence of Infidels during the hours of
worship is expressly forbidden, not only as being a source of mental
distraction to the faithful, but in reality an act of <i>perjury</i> on
their own part. &ldquo;It is not fitting that the idolaters should
visit the temples of God, <i>being witnesses against their own souls of
their infidelity</i>. The works of these men are vain, and they shall
remain in hell-fire forever. But he only shall visit the temples of
God, who believeth in God and the last day, and is constant at prayer,
and payeth legal alms, and feareth God alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Alms.</i>&mdash;The essence of Islamism, resignation to the will
of God, has its legitimate effect upon the benevolence of the
Mohammedans. If Allah bestows wealth and luxury, they receive and enjoy
the good gifts, but without any self-gratulation. If misfortune arrive,
they submit without any feeling of degradation, practically
illustrating the words of Job, &ldquo;Shall we receive good at the hand
of the Lord and not evil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The faithful are enjoined to be constant in prayer and give alms.
&ldquo;Contribute out of your substance towards the religion of God,
and throw not yourselves into perdition. Do good, for God loveth those
who <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name=
"pb59">59</a>]</span>do good; unto such of you as believe and bestow
alms, shall be given a great reward,&rdquo; and whoever pays not his
legal contribution of alms duly, it is declared by Mohammed, that he
shall have a serpent twisted about his neck at the resurrection; so
that the Mussulmans have every incentive to charity, both as regards
this life and that which is to come.</p>
<p>It is very common for them to found charitable institutions, such as
poorhouses, hospitals, etc., and the same principles of charity induce
them to an unlimited hospitality.</p>
<p>During the feast of Ramazan, a special table is set for the poor, in
the houses of the wealthy, who come and partake without summons or
invitation. The innumerable beggars and mendicant dervishes in Turkey,
are doubtless tolerated from the same spirit of liberality.</p>
<p>As the Koran is but a compilation from Jewish and Christian writers,
adapted to the spirit of the age in which it was promulgated, no doubt
the difficult but sublime doctrine of Christ, &ldquo;Let not thy right
hand know what thy left hand doeth,&rdquo; was appreciated by the
Prophet in his directions regarding the exercise of the grace of
charity: &ldquo;God loveth not the proud or vainglorious, nor those who
bestow their wealth in charity, to be observed of men.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Verily God will not wrong any one, even <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>the
weight of an ant, and if it be a good action, He will double it, and
will recompense it in his sight with a great reward.&rdquo; Their
charities are, therefore, bestowed with the greatest modesty and
willingness, their supplications for aid from others made without any
air of servility.</p>
<p>It devolves, then, upon modern civilization to establish corporate
and organized charitable bodies in Turkey, and to initiate the simple
Mussulmans into the self satisfaction which is awakened by public
meetings, and the parade of printed records.</p>
<p><i>Fasting.</i>&mdash;We live to eat, or we eat to
live&mdash;therefore when we are denied the great business and aim of
life, we undergo a very palpable kind of mortification. The dainty
epicurean seldom conforms to any regulations for extra abstemiousness,
while others, more superstitious, merely vary the hours of their
repast&mdash;merging the substantial meal into those which have not the
nomenclature, but yet become the reality of a good dinner. Again, the
pleasant variety of fish for fowl, or of oil for butter, does not leave
any sensation of emptiness, or mortification of the appetite. But there
is a sort of genuineness in the Mohammedan style of observing a
fast&mdash;when, for fourteen consecutive hours, absolutely nothing
passes the lips&mdash;not a drop of water, not even the homemade saliva
is swallowed&mdash;no hunger-easing pipe is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>smoked,
nor anything indulged in to palliate the gnawings of hunger and thirst.
The laborer toils under a summer sun&mdash;the weary <i>hammal</i>
climbs the towering hills under an incredible load&mdash;the athletic
boatman for many hours pulls the oars; work, toil, labor cease not, but
the wonted sustenance is utterly <span class="corr" id="xd25e1287"
title="Source: witheld">withheld</span>.</p>
<p>It is wonderful to see this part of the Mussulman population during
the fasting season&mdash;bodily strength and vigor exuding in profuse
perspiration from every pore, while steady persistence in utter
abstinence from all refreshment is persevered in.</p>
<p>This great monthly fast occurs once in every year&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The month of Ramazan shall ye fast, in which the Koran was
sent down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they observe the lunar year, it falls in all seasons&mdash;and
when it occurs during the dog-days, the sufferings of the faithful are
truly great and distressing. Not only are they forbidden all lusts of
the belly and the flesh, such as may be committed by the eye, ear,
tongue, hand, feet and other members, but the heart must be abstracted
as much as possible from the world, and turned only to God and
paradise&mdash;thus, a season of holy rest is instituted.</p>
<p>Among the many idlers who can afford to loiter away the day, some
assume an appearance of unusual sanctimoniousness, whose peculiarly
long faces and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>abstracted airs, most effectually ward off any
attempts to recall them to the realities of life.</p>
<p>They listlessly toy with their chaplets, gazing into vacancy as
polished bead after bead slips through their fingers, and seemingly are
as divested of thought, as the unmeaning, but apparently, absorbing
playthings they ever dangle. These beads have no such significance as
the Catholic rosaries, but are always in the hand of the Oriental
gentlemen and ladies, and are often of great value, being composed of
large pearls and other precious gems, though the ordinary style is to
make them of cocoa shells, whale teeth, ivory or amber.</p>
<p>During this fast the faithful are at the gate of religion, and the
very odor of their breath is considered to be sweeter than musk to the
olfactories of Allah!</p>
<p>Some of them observe the fast in its true spirit and letter, and all
externally conform to its regulations. No doubt to those who are
incapable of religious ecstasies, who cannot transport themselves out
of the world, while clogged with their human tenements, who relish not
the unsubstantial viands of a superstitious faith, the hours drag very
heavily on from sunrise to sunset.</p>
<p>Physical necessities sometimes force the less spiritualized to taste
some of the forbidden fruits, or to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63"
href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>avail themselves of this
occasion to test the truth of the proverb, that &ldquo;Stolen waters
are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more faithful, in the midst of their sufferings remember that as
Mohammed was, fortunately, of human mould like themselves, he informed
them &ldquo;God would make this an ease unto you and not a
difficulty&mdash;therefore * * * * * God knoweth that ye defraud
yourselves therein and forgiveth you, and now therefore * * * * * and
earnestly desire that which God ordaineth you, and eat and drink until
ye can plainly distinguish a white thread by the day-break, then keep
the fast until night,&rdquo; &amp;c.</p>
<p>Thus the faithful acquire new zest for all their sensual appetites
as they anxiously listen for the sunset Ezan, which releases them from
their sufferings. The breaking of the fast is called <i>Iftar</i>. Each
person is furnished with a small table, upon which are a bowl of light
soup, a few olives, some preserves and cakes. A chibouk, already filled
and ready to be lighted, is placed by their side. When the cannon
booming over the Bosphorus, announces the setting sun, each one
partakes sparingly of these refreshments, and having regaled himself
with the fumes of tobacco, attends to his regular sunset prayers, after
which a sumptuous dinner is served and enjoyed. The grand <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name="pb64">64</a>]</span>Namaz
(prayer) is performed, after which night is turned into day. The
streets, usually dark and sombre, are brightly illuminated and filled
with people, Mussulmans, Armenians, Greeks, Jews, and other Giavours,
who all seem anxious to enjoy the carnival, if not to share the
penance. The slender and tapering minar&eacute;s are now girdled in
light, while between the consecrated spires, depend fantastic and
luminous bodies, the brilliant but mimic forms of familiar objects. The
kahv&eacute;s are crowded with wearied Mussulmans, puffing out clouds
of smoke, in pure spite for their long abstinence from their favorite
weed, while their imaginations are regaled with the exciting tales of
the <i>Meddahs</i>, or the drolleries of the far famed
Kara-gue&ouml;z.</p>
<p>Stalls are erected with all the various preparations of food
peculiarly agreeable to Turkish palates; tempting shops stand
invitingly open, and tinkling music vibrates through the air. If Allah
only is remembered in the day, night seems to exclude that divinity
from every thought; while Eblis is apparently enthroned with all the
orgies of his dominions.</p>
<p>Exhausted nature at length compels the laboring classes to seek
their couches, while the more fortunate pashas and efendis, beguile the
remaining hours till morn, with continued festivities and the exchange
of social visits. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href="#pb65"
name="pb65">65</a>]</span></p>
<p>Just before daybreak, the drum resounds through the streets of the
metropolis, when the faithful, without any reluctance, arise from their
slumbers to avail themselves of their last chance of regaling their
appetites and fortifying their corporeal frames against the sufferings
of the next fourteen consecutive hours.</p>
<p>The morning gun, now booming upon the still air, re-echoed from hill
to hill, proclaims the dawn of another day, of self mortification at
the &ldquo;gate of Heaven.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">How true the observation that the most helpless of all
creatures is man, born of a woman, who cometh forth like the tender bud
of a delicate and fading flower.</p>
<p>The ever-living soul embarks on the vast ocean of life, in so frail
and delicate a tenement, that there is no semblance of strength to
resist the angry waves that continually dash against the tempest-tossed
and quivering fabric.</p>
<p>But it outrides the storm of three score years and ten, until it is
engulfed in the maelstrom and eddying circles of the river of Death.
How vast, how exquisite are the sensibilities of man, whose first
emotions of pleasure and pain, are the alphabet of humanity.</p>
<p>The pleasure felt by a sentient being, creates the first ideas of
good, while on the other hand the sensation of pain is synonymous with
evil. As we awake <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href="#pb68"
name="pb68">68</a>]</span>into existence, each passing moment seems to
develop new desires; our grasping souls and bodily wants are constantly
re-echoing each other&rsquo;s cravings; unsatisfied human nature is
ever on the alert, crying, give, give. This restless search for good,
pleasure, or happiness, leads its victims astray, and thus is created
the preponderance of evil; for such hot and eager haste stays not to
discriminate. The fatal apple seemed so good and so much to be desired
to the mother of all living, that she took, and ate; but when she had
eaten her eyes were opened. Thus by such efforts to secure the good,
the limit is overstepped, and suffering and sorrow entailed. Still,
none enjoy, and none suffer in the same degree; innumerable have been
the specimens of nature&rsquo;s handiwork, yet never were any two
individuals alike in their natural or intellectual structure.</p>
<p>There is a wonderful connection between the physical and the moral
in our curious composition; and the latter is so much modified by the
former, that the variety of temperaments and dispositions may be
attributed to the reciprocal influences of these two constituents of
our being. The origin of good and evil is then embodied in our own
hearts, in the structure of the human frame, in our natural
susceptibilities to pleasure and pain.</p>
<p>The individuality of pleasure and pain creates an <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>approving and disapproving principle in every
human frame, and each man is pleased with himself, when he enjoys a
personal benefit from good or pleasure, and displeased when he suffers
from the consequences of pain or evil. The lesson is soon learned that
the evil might have been avoided, and conscience raises her silent
testimony in the bosom. Apart from our own sensations, there seems to
be a superstitious principle innate in the human breast, a deference to
a supreme good, which as the Ruler and Creator of the universe, holds
all created things in awe, and to whom the conscience or self-approving
and self-condemning principle pays all deference.</p>
<p>This principle has existed under every form of humanity, in every
variety of nation and blood, and has been educated, and developed by
different circumstances.</p>
<p>Thus are derived all religions, and the fear of retribution for
transgressing the bounds which conscience claims for the real good, and
its essence the supreme Creator, has led men to various acts of
atonement or self-recommendation.</p>
<p>The mind of man instinctively looked from &ldquo;Nature up to
Nature&rsquo;s God,&rdquo; and sought an embodiment for the Divine
essence, as there was for the human.</p>
<p>The earliest semblance of Divinity was displayed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>in the
sun, moon, and stars. The glorious orb of day, the great source of
light and heat, the vivifier of all creation, whose genial rays warming
the bosom of the mother earth, caused the tender grass to spring forth,
and every herb yielding fruit, to give its increase for the sustenance
of animal life, the great luminary of the vast universe, so beautiful
to gaze upon, and so powerful in its sway over the world alotted to man
for a dwelling-place, seemed as if placed in the heavens for the
especial adoration of all created things.</p>
<p>The gentle moon with silver sheen, and softer radiance was fitting
bride for the all glorious and omnipotent god of day. And the sparkling
stars, like so many distant portals to the dominions of divine
effulgence, emitting each a ray of the internal brightness, seemed one
and all shrines of holy devotion.</p>
<p>Such was the revelation of nature; and no wonder that the innate
impulse to revere and worship the Author of the universe, was kindled
into a fire of enthusiasm by the scintillations of the starry
world.</p>
<p>Not content with the semblance of the Creator in his works, the
ever-working mind of man sought an object more tangible&mdash;and thus,
doubtless originated the idol worship of the ancients. Then followed a
succession of creeds and dogmas, rites and ceremonies, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>to which
the superstitious principle was ever ready to yield obeisance.</p>
<p>Ambitious and designing men sought to embody in themselves the germs
of sanctity and holiness&mdash;even did they add the sanction of
intercourse with the gods; even did they awaken the silent marble into
mysterious life, and utter oracles and decrees from the lifeless
stone.</p>
<p>Thus was nurtured the superstitious feeling in the multitude, until
the most absurd and revolting rites became the sole end, and aim of
existence&mdash;until the simple Hindoo, would, with a holy zeal, cast
himself under the wheels of the ponderous car of Juggernaut, and while
his tortured body was crushed to atoms, rejoice with ecstatic faith in
future felicity.</p>
<p>The same principle of superstitious self-torment has existed in as
great force under the Christian dispensation.</p>
<p>Even kings and emperors have tried to stifle the voice of conscience
by the most severe acts of penance and humiliation; and the humbler
members of the human family have willingly suffered every variety of
bodily anguish, which the most cunning devices of a wily and
calculating priesthood could contrive, while from many and hidden
motives, they have striven to produce an entire abnegation of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name=
"pb72">72</a>]</span>self, and a renunciation of all worldly hopes in
the sin-tormented hearts of their victims.</p>
<p>Wars were undertaken, territories were coveted, and a holy crusade
was the pretext for taking possession of the city of Jerusalem, the
shrine of the holy sepulchre, and where crowds of pilgrims brought
their offerings and laid them in the coffers of the sanctuary.</p>
<p>The dangers which beset the pilgrims amid the scimitars of the
barbarous Tartars, was the pretext for all Europe to rise in arms with
the determination to conquer or die in their defence.</p>
<p>A wild enthusiast, with haggard features&mdash;a body worn and
wasted with fasting and holy vigils, and enveloped in coarse and dusty
sackcloth, elevating the symbolic cross in his attenuated fingers,
wanders from palace to palace, from house to house, from hut to hamlet,
calling aloud for vengeance upon the followers of the Crescent, who
dared to molest the children of God in the performance of their sacred
duties. As his naked feet, pierced by every flinty rock, leave their
crimson stains in his track, so does the thirst for Moslem blood burn
and consume the vitals of the restless human throngs, who listen to his
wild harangues.</p>
<p>Pope Urban was ready to fan this flame, and the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>panting
multitude were by his holy and supreme power absolved from the weight
of all past offences as well as all those they should ever commit, if
they would prosecute with zeal this holy war.</p>
<p>The worst of sinners, robbers and assassins, over whose hardened
hearts there still lingered the dying glow of the internal fire of
conscience, or before whose sin-distempered vision ever flittered the
phantoms of past transgressions, rejoiced to say avaunt for ever, to
the ghosts of their departed crimes, and feel an assurance of no future
retribution for their dark deeds of horror. A new field for rapine and
adventure opened before them, and they rushed impetuously on to the
combat. Many, who had led a life of more retired wickedness and grown
grey in sin were glad to seize a hope of salvation even on the borders
of eternity, and tottered along with the vast concourse.</p>
<p>Rich and poor, young and old, with fervid zeal embraced the means of
future happiness beyond the grave. And the vast territory through which
these soldiers of the Cross wended their way was whitened with the
bones of the self sacrificed.</p>
<p>Even after the great champion Godfrey de Bouillon, had gained the
prize, and enjoyed a regal rank of one short year&rsquo;s duration, he
had to surrender his earthly throne to his holiness at Rome, and
content <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>himself like his followers with the hopes of a
kingdom in the unseen world.</p>
<p>Vain would be the effort to count the victims of religious
enthusiasm; of the attempts to appease the great unseen essence of
human life; to propitiate the favor of that Power, which, as it has
called into being, can also summon his creatures from their earthly
tenements, and dispose of their spirits, as seemeth best to his
sovereign will.</p>
<p>But holy wars, and sin-atoning pilgrimages, are not confined to the
followers of the Cross.</p>
<p>Wherever the Cresent glitters on the dome, or the muezzin proclaims
the ezan from the pointed minar&eacute;; wherever throughout the vast
dominions of the Mussulmans, resounds the cry Allah Ikber! Allah Ikber!
are the countless votaries of the religion of Mohammed, ready to arise
from their peaceful homes, and perform the sacred journey to the shrine
of their faith, the holy temple at Mecca. And year after year, do the
pilgrims trace a wearisome way through desert plains and scorching
heats, to the spot where they may roll off the burden of
self-condemnation, and kiss the all-atoning stone, which has been the
heirloom to mortality, since the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>Although throngs of Mussulman pilgrims yearly visit the holy city of
Mecca, but few Europeans have left the impress of their footsteps upon
its soil. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span></p>
<p>What millions of human beings, nothing intimidated by deserts,
mountains, and all sorts of hardships, have paid their devotions to
this shrine! The great have visited it with pomp, and all its train of
luxury and display; the grasping spirit of trade, has summoned
merchants from all parts of the East. The learned and wise, of times
that were, and times that are, have on the same occasion, collecting
the productions of genius, sought a mart for literature and renown.
Sultanas, and ladies of high and noble rank, have changed their silken
couches for wandering homes through the desert.</p>
<p>Old age has tottered thither staff in hand, and poverty has never
failed to swell the concourse with its numberless train. The vast
multitude, hundreds of thousands of every rank and profession, crying
&ldquo;La Illah! Il-Allah! Mohammed Ressoul Ullah!&rdquo; every year
people the silent wastes of sand with the buzz of human voices, as they
toil along their weary way to the holy city of Mecca.</p>
<p>Every Mohammedan is enjoined to perform this pilgrimage, or if
unable to go, to send a proxy, or an offering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Verily, the first house appointed unto men to worship in, was
that which is in Mecca, blessed, and a <i>direction</i> to all
creatures.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76"
name="pb76">76</a>]</span></p>
<p>For there was the Kubla, or point to which they were to turn their
faces in prayer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And proclaim unto the people a solemn pilgrimage; let them
come unto thee on foot, and on every lean camel, arriving from every
distant road; that they may be witnesses of the advantages which accrue
to them from the visiting this holy place, and may commemorate the name
of God, on the appointed days, in gratitude for the brute cattle which
he hath bestowed on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the traditions of the Arabs, the city of Mecca has been
the place of religious veneration, from the earliest times. Near this
city, on a mountain, Adam is said to have met his wife Eve, two hundred
years after the expulsion from Paradise.</p>
<p>Here when Abraham was ready to sacrifice his son Ishmael (not
Isaac), the identical ram, which had been offered by Abel many years
before, was substituted in his place, sent expressly from Paradise.</p>
<p>Here also, in the days of idolatry, was a temple dedicated to
Saturn, now the holy temple of Mecca. So that Mohammed found this place
already consecrated by sacred and ancient associations.</p>
<p>Mecca, the birth-place, and Medina, the tomb of the Prophet, are
situated near each other; and not far from the coast of the Red Sea.
Mecca is in a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>valley surrounded by barren hills, which produce
nothing but the stones of which the houses are constructed. Water, so
essential to life, and most especially to all Mussulmans, is only
supplied by rain which is collected in cisterns; no streams flowing
from the adjacent mountains. Doubtless, the exceeding value all
Mohammedans attach to the pure element, is owing to its scarcity in
these regions, where their religion was promulgated, and the Koran
revealed from heaven. Their Paradise is represented as abounding in
fountains.</p>
<p>There is &ldquo;the water of <i>Keafeeree</i>, or camphor,&rdquo; a
fountain at which the people of God shall drink, so likened from the
aromatic freshness of this gum, and its snowy whiteness. The waters of
<i>zengefeel</i> or ginger, and the fountain of <i>zelzebil</i>, whose
streams glide softly down the throat; and the fountain of Taz-nim,
which flows from the highest regions of Paradise, and whereof those
shall drink who approach the Divine presence.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the barrenness of the soil and the unfavorable
situation of the city of Mecca, the wealth of its inhabitants is very
great.</p>
<p>Arabia Felix, truly happy in <span class="corr" id="xd25e1463"
title="Source: comparision">comparison</span> to the barren and desert
tracts by which she is surrounded, where the gentle zephyrs are
perfumed and laden with aromatic odors, whose villages and towns are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name=
"pb78">78</a>]</span>crowned with plenty, and adorned with gardens of
delight, and trees bearing all kinds of fruit, &ldquo;Araby the
blest&rdquo; pours her treasures into this holy city. Her gums and
spices, olibanum, or frankincense, myrrh of many kinds, balsams, sugar
canes, cocoa nuts, and the fragrant berry from Mocha. Nature rejoices
in a perpetual spring, in this genial clime which neither chills nor
scorches her spicy products.</p>
<p>In Mecca, congregate a vast crowd of Mussulmans with their
merchandise from all quarters of the East, so that the inducement, held
out by the Prophet, that &ldquo;they may be witnesses of the advantages
which accrue from visiting this holy place,&rdquo; has no little power
on the calculations of the enterprising, while a misguided religious
zeal sways the multitude.</p>
<p>The holy temple of Mecca has been under the successive patronage of
the caliphs, the sultans of Egypt and of Turkey, until by the constant
acquisition of wealth, it has attained its present splendid
magnificence.</p>
<p>No unbeliever can profane the sacred precincts with the dust of his
feet, nor approach within gun shot of the consecrated portico, during
the season of the visitation of the pilgrims. Nor must the Faithful
defile their sinless bodies by any contact with the unsanctified flesh
and blood of the infidel Jews and Christians. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;O true believers, verily the idolaters are unclean; let them
not therefore come near unto the holy temple after this year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if ye fear want, by the cutting off trade, and
communication with them, God will enrich you of his abundance, if he
pleaseth; for God is knowing and wise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not fitting that the idolaters should visit the temples
of God, being witnesses against their own souls of their
infidelity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considering the resources which have contributed to construct and
adorn this shrine of the Mohammedan faith, the great wealth of many
nations, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name=
"pb80">80</a>]</span>centuries which have successively rolled on, each
adding the superstitious offerings of religious votaries, it is no
wonder that it is magnificent to behold. The model from Paradise, the
rebuilding by Abram, and its preservation for so many years.</p>
<p>The whole city of Mecca is considered holy ground but the objects of
special adoration are inclosed within a magnificent colonnade, the
foundation of which was laid by the second caliph Omer, to prevent
intrusion upon the <span lang="la">sanctum sanctorum</span>. The space
inclosed by this portico is about seven statium. The foundations are
broad and lofty, and approached by an extended flight of marble steps,
on both sides, without and within. No less than four hundred and
eighty-four columns support an arched entablature, which is crowned by
a succession of domes, surmounted by glittering crescents. The
colonnade is quadrangular, and in the four corners are minar&eacute;s,
raising their tapering spires to heaven, in emblem of the ascending
orisons of the faithful, and from whose gilded galleries the sacred
imams have, since unnumbered suns have risen and set, proclaimed the
hours of adoration.</p>
<p>No gloomy darkness ever enshrouds this structure; for when day
withdraws its more glaring brightness, innumerable lamps cast their
fitful light around the pillars. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81"
href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span></p>
<p>What tales could these marble columns whisper of human hopes, and
even holier aspirations; of the wicked schemes of intriguing imams, as
with sacerdotal robes and turbans of emerald hue, they traced their
cautious way from pillar to pillar, and received and blessed the vast
concourse of souls, borne down with the ills and sins of humanity. How
honeyed their benedictions as they lay their gilded palms on the humble
suppliant, who would gladly bestow all his earthly treasures for a sure
hope of heaven where his joys would be enduring.</p>
<p>Poor weak mortals! tools of each other, and victims of the
calculating; the deceiver and deceived, on the same journey, on the
same race course, where the goal is Eternity!</p>
<p>Beneath these domes, and overshadowed by these tall minar&eacute;s,
the poet and the scholar have met to repeat the traditions and romances
so peculiar to the glowing imaginations of the Oriental world, and to
vie with each other for literary fame; the astrologer and diviner, no
doubt the very genii and fairies of Arabian myth, have mingled in the
throng.</p>
<p>With what emotion have the deluded victims of superstition and
remorse prostrated themselves upon the hallowed ground, and with what
ecstatic faith in the rewards of their holy pilgrimage, have the only
true believers kissed the dust of the consecrated earth. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span></p>
<p>Within this beautiful portico, there is a vast space, in the middle
of which stands the Caaba itself.</p>
<p>After Adam was driven from Paradise, he begged the Almighty to allow
him to erect a Beit-el-maamur, or house of God, similar to the one he
had seen there. Therefore the Caaba was let down to Mecca, directly
under the Heavenly Temple. This was rebuilt after the deluge by Abram,
or as some say, again descended from the celestial realms, where it had
been preserved, and has been in the possession of the Ishmaelites, or
Arabs, ever since.</p>
<p>The Caaba, or house of God, is a square building of stone, 24 cubits
long, 23 broad and 27 high. It is nearly surrounded by a semicircular
colonnade, at the base of which is a low balustrade.</p>
<p>Bars of silver, from which lamps are suspended, connect the pillars
at the top.</p>
<p>How mystic and beautiful are the glimmerings of these lights, as
they glisten on the dark night, in their silver lamps, casting
uncertain shadows around the marble columns&mdash;their dubious shining
conjuring up the shades of the Prophet and his honored descendants, all
arrayed in jealous and sacred green to watch the devotions of the
multitude, as they surround the shrine.</p>
<p>The outside of the Caaba is covered with rich black damask, which is
renewed every year. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83"
name="pb83">83</a>]</span></p>
<p>The holy imams, pitying the true and faithful, and wishing to ward
off from them the dangers of sudden death, and the thousand other
casualties of life, bestow a small portion of the covering of this
house of God, which has imbibed the sanctity of three hundred and
sixty-five <span class="corr" id="xd25e1524" title=
"Source: days,">days&rsquo;</span> duration, and, therewith, the power
to avert all such evils. A small amount of worldly wealth is sufficient
to touch the heart of the holy Emir, who grants this precious charm,
which, resting in the bosom of its happy possessor, yields to him a
sweet repose from the anticipation of sudden trials which befall the
less fortunate inheritors of human life.</p>
<p>Outside of this black damask is a band of gold which surrounds the
Caaba, and whose lustre is undimmed by time, for it is renewed every
year by the sultan of Turkey. The very rain which flows from the roof
of this edifice, partakes of its sanctity, and is conducted therefrom
by a spout of solid gold, whence it trickles down on the tomb of
Ishmael, the head and founder of the Arab race.</p>
<p>Near the Caaba is the stone on which the patriarch Abraham stood,
when he was rebuilding the holy temple; and even his very foot-prints
are to be seen on the solid piece of rock, leaving no shadow of doubt
as to its identity. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84"
name="pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>This ancient architect, unwilling to deface the walls by a
scaffolding, when they were beyond his reach, stood upon this stone,
which chance threw in his way; and, wonderful interposition of Allah!
the stone raised him when necessary, let him down again, and
transported him around his precious work, until the whole was
finished!</p>
<p>What a treasure to architecture, more worthy of fame than the
undiscovered stone of the philosopher; how carefully to be watched and
guarded from the profanations of unbelieving house-builders for all
time to come.</p>
<p>Upon the southeast corner of the Caaba is the black stone set in
silver, which was dropped down from Paradise.</p>
<p>Like other gems of the heavenly sphere, it was originally white and
shining&mdash;but alas! its brightness is dimmed, and even changed to
perfect blackness, by its contact with human sin. For ever since its
removal to this world, it has been polluted by the touch of mortals,
and the contact of their sinful lips.</p>
<p>The interior of the Caaba is approached by a silver door, about the
height of a man from the ground, to which they ascend by movable steps.
There is a single room hung with red and green <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name=
"pb85">85</a>]</span>embroidered damask, and the roof is supported by
four pillars eight feet square, made of aloes wood.</p>
<p>A sweet perfume pervades this apartment, which has been emitted from
these pillars ever since Mohammed was born in the holy city of Medina,
and silver lamps are suspended, which burn night and day. Near the
Caaba are small chapels for the imams of the different Mohammedan
sects, who severally bestow their blessings upon the pilgrims.</p>
<p>The agonized mother of Ishmael, wandering in the wilderness, her
scanty bottle of water quite empty, having cast her helpless infant
under the shrubs, and retreated that she might not see him die, sat at
a distance and lifted up her voice and wept.</p>
<p>The dying moans of the infant reached the ears of the angel of God,
who, to save the father of a great nation, caused the well-spring of
water to gush forth from its recesses in the bowels of the earth.</p>
<p>As the ministering angel wiped the tears from the eyes of the
disconsolate mother, she spied the crystal water, and hastened to
administer to the fainting child. This same well, called the well of
zem-zem, is near the holy house of prayer, and the thirsty pilgrims
every year quaff its venerated waters and carry some of it to all parts
of the Mohammedan dominions.</p>
<p>Such being the holy places, no wonder that every <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>Mussulman, whether commanded or not, should desire
to visit these sacred relics of antiquity.</p>
<p>And were it not forbidden, doubtless the unbelievers also would
gladly undertake the same pilgrimage to witness the miraculous
preservation of objects which are, some of them, incorporated with
their own faith.</p>
<p>Four caravans meet in the city of Mecca, in the month Zil-hidjay, or
the month of pilgrimage, every year&mdash;one from Cairo, one from
Constantinople, a third from the Barbary states, and a fourth from
India. The Egyptian caravan waits for the arrival of the one from
Constantinople at Redowa near the holy cities. As the Sultan of Turkey
holds the possession of the holy cities in his own territories, he is
bound to send certain offerings to the shrine, which are the gold band
and black damask covering for the Caaba, with a large sum of money to
be distributed among the priests at Mecca. A certain kind of money is
expressly coined at the royal mint for the pilgrimage, called the Caaba
money. It is in gold pieces, and every one who goes to Mecca must
provide himself with this circulating medium.</p>
<p>The wants of the numerous poor pilgrims are provided for in part, by
an appeal to the superstitions of the populace. A model of the temple
at Mecca is paraded through the streets followed by a crowd of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>the zealous chanting hosannas in Arabic,
accompanied by the music of a drum of antique contrivance.</p>
<p>But few can withhold a tribute. The miser opens his hoards, and the
widow adds her slender mite; the grandee and the slave, one and all,
gladly answer the appeal of their fellows, when under a banner of such
sacred veneration, and for a cause so laudable as a pilgrimage to the
holy shrine of their faith. Rich and poor are busily employed in
preparations.</p>
<p>The dervish in his humble robes, needs no costly array. His garb of
sanctity, and the renunciation of all the trappings of wealth, open the
purses of the more gaily apparelled; and often the rags of a mendicant
conceal a full purse, much better filled perhaps, than his, who has
spent his all on costly embroideries and richly caparisoned steeds.</p>
<p>The pasha and the efendi arrange their financial affairs, taking
care to carry costly offerings, and largesse, wherewith to impress the
multitude with their own greatness.</p>
<p>The ladies of the harems, in like manner, collect their jewels,
their perfumes, in a word gifts of all things esteemed rare and
precious, that they may not go empty-handed to the holy temple.</p>
<p>The merchants pack up their silks and rich stuffs <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>of all
sorts, and prepare for edification both temporal and spiritual.</p>
<p>Considering the immense throng of pilgrims, what must be the din of
preparation throughout the Ottoman dominion?</p>
<p>Constantinople, its sultan, its treasury, its inhabitants high and
low, its ladies, its saints and beggars&mdash;even the lisping children
are whispering, God is great, Mohammed is his Apostle, and the Caaba is
the house of God. The Egyptian viceroy is assembling his horseman and
his camels at Berket el Hadge; the Maghrubees, or Barbaresques, are
sharpening their scimitars, and preparing as if for war. India&rsquo;s
wealth, her pearls, shawls, and rubies, and stately elephants, are
slowly wending their way to the shores of the Persian Gulf, where at al
Katif, on the Arabian side, the old sheikh is tarrying with his herds
of camels, to sell or hire them for the passage of the desert.</p>
<p>The holy Mecca is thus, for several months at least, the theme of
all classes of Mohammedans.</p>
<p>At length the day arrives to begin the journey so fraught with
blessings temporal and spiritual.</p>
<p>The conductor of the Constantinople caravan, called the
<i>Surr&eacute; Emminee</i>, or the trustee of the pilgrimage, proceeds
to the palace, to receive his commission <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span>from the sultan; and to
him are consigned all the treasures destined for Mecca.</p>
<p>All hopes of worldly aggrandizement are henceforth renounced by this
dignitary; for having once imbibed the holy atmosphere of Mecca, his
future aspirations are supposed to be only heavenward. He therefore,
upon his return, generally retires to Damascus, where, nearer to the
shrine, and in a clime more genial for holiness, he awaits his
translation into that Paradise, of which his earthly honors are the
type and foretaste.</p>
<p>Quitting the august presence of the &ldquo;Thrice happy lord of the
refulgent Mecca,&rdquo; the Surr&eacute; Emminee goes to the Porte,
where he takes leave of his former colleagues in temporal greatness,
and thence to the gate of the Sheikh-ul-Islam, who grants his blessing
on the enterprise.</p>
<p>The pilgrims and others collect about him, and they proceed to
Bahchai Capusoo, where a steamer is waiting to transport them over to
Scutari, in Asia.</p>
<p>There, all along the route, are multitudes of people waiting to see
the procession.</p>
<p>The insignia of the Surr&eacute; Emminee are borne before him; two
long poles, to which the expressive horse-tails are attached, and the
<i>Pasha of two tails</i> follows on a beautiful Arabian charger.</p>
<p>The treasures destined for Mecca succeed on a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>train of
camels, all bedecked with ribbons and spangles. But this world&rsquo;s
grandeurs are bestowed unequally even to these patient animals; for
there is one of their number who outshines all his fellows. A venerable
camel is covered with trappings enriched with precious stones of rare
and sparkling lustre, for on his back he carries the sacred Koran
extravagantly bound, and enclosed in a golden box set in brilliants;
the gift of the sultan to the temple.</p>
<p>Happy is this <span class="corr" id="xd25e1613" title=
"Source: distinguised">distinguished</span> animal, and his companions
also, if they survive the pilgrimage and return; for, like the
Surr&eacute; Emminee, they are exempt from all future toil in this
work-day world; and when Death at last claims them for his prey, they
enjoy the honors of a burial, where no rude dogs or vultures can
disturb their remains.</p>
<p>The Valid&eacute; Sultan, or the mother of the sultan, reclines in
her Tahtravan, a sort of elongated sedan chair, which is suspended on
long poles between two camels and magnificent in proportion to the high
rank of its occupant.</p>
<p>Mussulman women and children follow, in huge panniers, suspended on
the sides of camels, horses, and donkeys.</p>
<p>Indeed, the good fathers and husbands of the Osmanlis are ever
anxious to ensure to the female portion of their families high places
in the celestial <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=
"pb91">91</a>]</span>regions; and they are generally accompanied by
their harems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is incumbent on him whose family shall not be present at
the holy temple, to fast three days in the pilgrimage, and seven when
he is returned; they shall be ten days complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the same period of fasting is enjoined upon him &ldquo;who
findeth not anything to offer&rdquo; at the shrine.</p>
<p>Mohammed himself set an example in this respect; for when he
encompassed the Caaba, he was accompanied by his family, and his wife
Kadijah, who, with his daughter Fatima, were two of the four women whom
he pronounced to have attained a state of perfection on this side of
the grave.</p>
<p>Trains of servants, led horses and camels, swell the concourse; and
the whole is protected by a body of cavalry.</p>
<p>About six miles from Scutari, there is a fountain which bears the
name of Iraluk Cheshmaysee, or the fountain of separation.</p>
<p>Thus far a number of friends and relations have accompanied the
pilgrims; but, as in the journey of life, none can carry their loved
ones with them into the celestial regions, so these travellers who are
on an emblematic pilgrimage must now sunder strong ties, and loosen
their hearts from earthly affections.</p>
<p>Fountain of parting! how are thy streams now <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name=
"pb92">92</a>]</span>accumulating, as the pearly drops of human woe
trickle in among thy waters; how many days must pass ere those waters
regain their crystal brightness, now all turbid with the crimson
gushings of the heart blood of fathers, mothers, wives, husbands, and
children!</p>
<p>Sadly they part: some turn their faces homeward with bitter sighs,
while the pilgrims pursue their course, every advancing step widening
the distance, till their clouded eyes can discern no further traces of
the severed.</p>
<p>Even as faith reveals to the dying the glory of a celestial world,
and reconciles the most trembling to a passage from the dim scenes of
Earth; so does superstition foreshadowing the hour of mortal
dissolution, display an earthly temple as the vestibule to the
heavenly.</p>
<p>With eager steps, the pilgrims now press onwards, till they reach
the most ancient and beautiful city of Damascus; where they halt for
the caravans from Bagdad, Aleppo, and the neighboring towns. Time-worn
associations flit about this monument of the wealth of the earliest
founders of cities, after the universal deluge.</p>
<p>As the descendants of the great survivor of the wreck of the
antediluvian world sought out a portion of the wide expanse of
uninhabited, and as yet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href=
"#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>uncultivated earth, this lovely
valley of nature&rsquo;s own handiwork seemed to invite their tarrying,
as it lay in calm repose, all fresh and verdant from the great waste of
waters. Perhaps they discovered the ruins of a great city, the remnants
of ancestral wealth; or the relics of the luxury and degeneracy which
brought about the awful destruction of the victims of the flood.</p>
<p>Rapidly rose the proud city, and was famed even at the time of the
first battle of which there is any record, of the five kings against
four, the great Chedorlaomar and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah, when
the patriarch Abram went to rescue his nephew Lot, who had been taken
captive.</p>
<p>It was the birth-place, too, of Eliezer, the steward of Abram, who
must have been a man of superior attainments, as he had the care of all
his master&rsquo;s possessions, and even of the betrothal of his
beloved son Isaac.</p>
<p>This ancient capital of Syria did not escape the enthusiasm of
Moslem conquest, and the great Saracen generals, Abu-Obeidah and
Khaled, took possession of the famous city, after a slaughter of 50,000
infidels, during the reign of <span class="corr" id="xd25e1658" title=
"Source: Abubeker">Abubekir</span>, the successor of Mohammed, A. D.
633. Damascus now became the capital of the Ottoman dominions, and
their pride and glory; for they boast <i lang="tr">Evvely sham, Akhery
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>sham</i>, or, that as they had their beginning in
Sham or Damascus, so there also, they will have their end.</p>
<p>So precious do they esteem this city, that it is styled the pearl
surrounded by diamonds, and the gate of the most holy Mecca.</p>
<p>Here, then, at the most beautiful gate, do the pilgrims to the
sacred shrine delight to repose awhile, their senses ravished with the
loveliest enchantments of nature. Their eager vision extends over vast
plains of richly waving foliage, mingling with its emerald hues, the
brilliant tints of the citron, pomegranate, and fig. Sweet odors of
aromatic freshness pervade the balmy air, while luscious and juicy
fruits revive their thirsty senses. Over this vast and exquisite
prospect, tower tall minar&eacute;s, and graceful domes with glittering
crescents, proclaiming as far as the eye can reach, the sway of
Mohammed Ressoul Ullah.</p>
<p>But there is yet a weary way to the shrine, and the zealous throng,
now swelled to a vast multitude, renew their journey. If the weather is
very oppressive, they encamp in the day-time, and proceed by the light
of innumerable torches at night.</p>
<p>How mysterious the pageant, stretching its long train over the
barren and trackless sands. The camels, with stealthy step, waving
their long necks slowly and majestically; now and then the Arabian
coursers neighing in wearied restlessness, break the silence.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href="#pb95" name=
"pb95">95</a>]</span>Then a voice chanting a hymn of praise, and anon,
a shout or chorus from the multitude. Now all is still, and fitful
shadows glide along side by side with the wanderers, as the bright
jewels on the camels glisten in the torch-light.</p>
<p>The caravan has passed, leaving in its track many palpitating forms,
panting on the sands for that breath of life, which is rapidly exhaling
from their bodies.</p>
<p>So weary a way&mdash;sometimes no water to quench the thirst, which
rages in proportion to the scarcity of its antidote; fatigue adding its
prostrating effects day by day, no wonder that many of the way-worn
pilgrims are transferred to the Heavenly Temple, without a sight of the
earthly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span></p>
<p>The caravan from Cairo is also moving onwards, made up of a motley
multitude, headed by the Emir Hadgee, who is appointed by the pasha of
Cairo, and receives great emoluments from his office. Every pilgrim
pays him a certain sum for the enregistering of his name and property,
and the possessions of all those who die on the road, are also his
perquisites. He is the governor of the pilgrimage, and is judge and
jury in all matters of dispute. The Egyptians always carry with them
the tomb of Hassan, and accompanied by cavalry and artillery, they
proceed as far as Redowa, near Medina, where they are to meet the
Constantinople caravan. About two days&rsquo; journey from Cairo, they
arrive at a place called Miz-Haara, the ancient Marah of the
Israelites, where, when the people murmured at the bitterness of the
waters, Moses cast a tree into them, and they became sweet, of
surpassing sweetness to all thirsty pilgrims. Thus they travel over the
same wilderness as their ancient predecessors, encamping in the very
spots selected by Moses for the tents of the chosen people of God.</p>
<p>After these caravans meet, they proceed, a vast multitude, to a
village about sixty miles from Mecca, where is Abram&rsquo;s mountain,
on which he erected the altar to sacrifice his son.</p>
<p>On the top of this hill is a mosque, where an old <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>sheikh
resides, who, as the pilgrims halt, stands on the brow of the hill, and
delivers an address to them on the importance of the duty they are
performing, reminding them also of the blessings in store for all
zealous Mussulmans. To what an immense audience does this lonely old
man once a year proclaim the tenets of the Koran, and how eagerly do
their thirsty souls quaff the water of everlasting life as he dispenses
it.</p>
<p>Now the Emir Hadgee conducts the pilgrims one by one to the feet of
the sheikh, as he stands in the mosque on the top of the hill, Rabiie.
As they enter one door and pass out at the other in rapid succession,
each one is touched by the divining rod in the hands of the old sheikh,
and the burden of all their past transgressions rolls from their backs,
as he pronounces the words, &ldquo;May sin here leave thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lightened from the pressure of sin in every form, they run swiftly
down the hill, and bathing their hands and faces in a stream which
flows below, they become renewed, men, women, and children; and
prepared to gaze upon the holy city of Mecca, which is not far distant.
Now turning their faces to the shrine, the true believers hasten on
their way; sometimes halting at the tomb of Eve, which is at Giddeh,
the port of Mecca.</p>
<p>This illustrious and ancient mother of the human <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>race
must have been a dame of fair proportions; for her grave measures, from
the head to the foot stone, no less than twenty-five yards, or
seventy-five English feet. If she was of such exceeding stature, what
must have been the dimensions of our great parent Adam, or what lofty
personages must have been the <i>giants</i> of those days.</p>
<p>After travelling about three days longer, the domes of the Holy
Temple are descried in the distance; when the multitude with mad
delight prostrate themselves on the ground, and kissing the earth three
times, proclaim with tremendous clamor, La Illah! Ill Lallah! Mohammed
Ressoul Ullah!</p>
<p>There is no other God but God! Mohammed the Apostle of God!</p>
<p>The artillery is now fired to announce the arrival of the caravans
to the inhabitants of Mecca, who, headed by the Shereef of the city and
all the Imams, immediately proceed to meet the pilgrims, and conduct
them within the sacred precincts.</p>
<p>Those who possess but scanty means, encamp without the city, and
others are accommodated at khans, which are very numerous.</p>
<p>The next thing is to visit the bath, and thus purify themselves for
the ceremonies at the temple&mdash;&ldquo;I will wash my hands in
innocency, so will I compass thine altar, O Lord.&rdquo; Having
invested themselves in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href=
"#pb99" name="pb99">99</a>]</span>ehram, or covering of crimson woollen
shag, which is always wrapped around the person on this occasion, they
proceed to the Caaba.</p>
<p>Mohammed having performed these same ceremonies, his followers have
ever since imitated his example.</p>
<p>Immediately after the Prophet took possession of the city of Mecca,
he proceeded to the Caaba. There he stood upon the roof of the house of
prayer, and proclaimed the first <i>ezan</i>, or call to prayer, at
noon-day.</p>
<p>He then commenced his adorations at the shrine, by first kissing the
black stone in the corner, near the door of the Caaba, then he
proceeded to compass the building seven times, and then again kissed
the sin-atoning stone. When the Caaba was let down from heaven to Adam,
he requested that it might be so placed that he could compass it as he
had seen the angels do. Ever since the creation, the number seven has
had a mystic signification, and its sacred meaning is demonstrated in
these devotions of the faithful. Mohammed then proclaimed to the people
from Mount Arafat, the manner in which they were to perform the
ceremonies at the Temple, and went to the valley of Mina, where he
threw seven stones at the devil, every time pronouncing the words,
Allah Ikb&eacute;r! Allah Ikb&eacute;r! God Almighty! God <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>Omnipotent, as did Adam and Abraham, when the
great Adversary interrupted their devotions.</p>
<p>The enemies of the Prophet account for the accumulation of stones in
this valley by the following story.</p>
<p>It is well known that Mohammed was assisted in the preparation of
the Koran, by an Armenian monk, by name Serkiss. When their work was
completed, the Prophet wished to attest it by a miracle.</p>
<p>He accordingly persuaded Serkiss to descend into a deep well, while
he called all the multitude to assemble. Holding a blank book in his
hand, he declared that if the Koran was indeed revealed from Heaven, he
would drop this blank-book into the well, and Allah would send it up
all written and inscribed.</p>
<p>The book descended, and Serkiss sent up the one he had already
prepared. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Mohammed, &ldquo;let each man cast a
stone into the well, which will be a monument to the world.&rdquo;
Whereupon every one of the great concourse cast a stone, and thus
effectually prevented Serkiss from appearing to contradict the miracle.
Ever since that time, the pilgrims have helped to accumulate these
stones, until a vast monument, indeed, has been erected.</p>
<p>The Prophet now offered the sacrifice of sixty-three camels,
according to the years of his own life, shaved <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span>his
head, and having run seven times between the two hills Safa and Merwa,
in imitation of Hagar searching for water, he completed the holy
ceremonies.</p>
<p>According to this model have the pilgrims continued, ever since his
time, the performance of these superstitious devotions.</p>
<p>The holy duties of the shrine being over, after a few worldly cares
are disposed of, the now self-satisfied travellers turn their footsteps
homewards. Purified, and set apart, henceforth the chosen of Allah,
fearless of all danger, as if within the shadow of the eternal world,
nothing intimidates the followers of the Prophet, as with the greatest
self-complacency they anticipate the rest of their sojourn in this
lower world. Many have sacrificed all their earthly possessions, but
are they not sure of the imperishable riches of paradise. With eager
fondness, they embrace once again friends and relations, while the odor
of sanctity exhales from their sacred persons. With what panting bosoms
and restless vision do the friends search among the remnant returned
from the wanderings, for dear and familiar faces; and human wailings
rend the air, as they are told that brother, sister, and husband, lie
whitening on the sand, long ere this the prey of the vulture. The happy
father clasps to his breast his precious offspring, and with sweet
complacency, ties around its neck a morsel <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>the
holy covering of the Caaba, so sure the charm, and obtained at such
infinite perils. The pilgrims are surrounded, and with jealous caution
they bestow a few drops of the water of the holy well Zem-Zem, which
glides down the throats of the faithful like the oily fountains of
Paradise.</p>
<p>The weary camels even linger out their lives in luxurious idleness,
retired from oppressive service, with an air of unconscious sanctity
and repose.</p>
<p>Henceforward, the glorious title of Hadgee, belongs to the returned
pilgrim; no razor profanes the beard, and the very door of the house,
by its hue of the Prophet&rsquo;s robe, the sacred green, proclaims the
rank and holiness of its master.</p>
<p>The Hadgee, with long and solemn face, never wearies of recounting
his wonderful adventures, portraying with ecstasy, the splendors of the
shrine, detailing with holy rapture the ceremonies and devotions, until
the flame of superstitious zeal is enkindled in every bosom, and their
spirits yearn for the sweet sanctity and all-atoning atmosphere of the
most refulgent Mecca&mdash;and many vows are made that in the coming
year, their footsteps shall surely be thitherward.</p>
<p>Such, then, are the illusions which beguile life&rsquo;s wearisome
journey to the followers of Mohammed; such the stepping-stones to their
future Elysium. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103"
name="pb103">103</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus the tortures of conscience are eased, and thus does
superstition stand fully armed at the portals of the soul.</p>
<p>Few, indeed, are the members of the great human family, who dare to
combat this enemy to moral greatness; and how small the number of
those, who renounce her sway. Chained down to creeds and dogmas, the
mind of man seldom soars above the atmosphere of human inventions, but
relyingly lingers in the leading strings of bigotry, in one form or
another.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Thus is constituted the Practice of the Mohammedan Religion, viz.,
Ablutions, Prayers, Alms, Fasting, and the Pilgrimage to Mecca, which
are denominated <i>Farz</i>, or obligatory. There are, however, many
other traditional observances termed <i>S&uuml;nnet</i>, which as the
Turks are S&uuml;nnees or traditionists, they have incorporated with
their religious duties, such as circumcision, and many other rites.
These rites, whose observance is only optional, are, however, performed
with as much zeal and ceremony as those required by the Koran. Although
the ceremony of <span class="corr" id="xd25e1772" title=
"Source: circumsion">circumcision</span> is not alluded to in the
Koran, and therefore not indispensable, yet it is a custom generally
observed, and is performed when the child is able <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>to
pronounce the formula of faith &ldquo;La Illah, Ill Allah, Mohammed
Ressoul Ullah,&rdquo; or is about the age of seven years.</p>
<p>This is a great festival, and when the sultan&rsquo;s children, or
those of any of the grandees, are the neophytes, a general invitation
is extended to other candidates. Music, dancing, and feasting occupy
the minds and distract the thoughts of the numerous company, young and
old, during the week devoted to this ceremony. <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">PRINCIPLES OF THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A people descended from nomadic tribes, and, until
very recently, severed from foreign intercourse, would naturally retain
its simple and national type. Besides, the peculiar bond of an
exclusive faith, would still more tend to the preservation of ancient
and characteristic usages.</p>
<p>Thus the Osmanlis have, with hitherto but few deviations, preserved
their identity as an eminently patriarchal nation. As the son
recognized the parent to be the governor and controller of his career,
the fountain of experience and wisdom, and rendered to him a willing
and natural obedience; so the people, needing such a fatherly care and
control, were ready to invest one of their number with this
authority.</p>
<p>Every system has its centre. The sun rules in the heavens&mdash;and
the great mass of humanity seek a centre, around which to rally. The
wonderful magnetism <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106"
name="pb106">106</a>]</span>of mortal emotion tends to a common point,
as surely as the needle to the pole. Thus some species of monarchy,
whether elective or hereditary, seems inevitable to a multitude of
beings, cast in human mould.</p>
<p>Tribes were instituted in early times, each with its patriarch or
petty monarch; and when, for mutual strength or by conquest, these
various tribes were combined, the monarch, with increasing subjects,
became more powerful and distinguished.</p>
<p>When the wandering Tartars embraced Islamism, their chief becoming
the successor to the Caliphate, was not only their temporal, but
spiritual head. These two elements of power, church and state, endowed
the monarch with unlimited sway, beyond whom there could be no appeal.
The simple patriarch now becomes not only the father of his people, but
the representative of Allah; the sole controller of life and death,
property and religion. Years, even centuries, roll on, the scimitar
gains nation after nation, fertile territories and treasures to the
followers of the Crescent, and innumerable multitudes swarm around the
standard.</p>
<p>The Padi-Shah, or ruler of this vast concourse of men, the absolute
owner of the domain far and wide, now rejoices in the adulations of his
superstitious subjects who acknowledge him as the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107" name="pb107">107</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; Ruler of the East and West,
and of all parts of the world; Prince of the Holy and chaste city of
Jerusalem; shining with the brightness of God. Thrice happy Lord of the
refulgent Mecca. Tamer of infidels, and the scourger of the unbelieving
race of Christian vassals. Lord of the White (Mediterranean), and the
Black Seas. The most mighty and invincible Sultan, who has power from
God to rule all people with a bridle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many other similar titles are bestowed upon him, which, though they
may seem somewhat bombastic, or even ridiculous, in these days of
equality and freedom, yet are not unparalleled in some of the more
civilized realms of modern Europe; nor without their legitimate
influences upon the subjects of this potentate.</p>
<p>In order to illustrate the wonderful effect which the assumption of
such high-sounding appellatives has upon the general mass of the
people, I will relate an incident which happened to myself:&mdash;</p>
<p>During a recent sail on the Bosphorus in a cayik, and immediately
after the arrival of the allied fleets, I thought to amuse myself with
some political chit-chat with my boatman. As I was remarking about the
assistance of the Allies, the simple-minded, but thorough Mussulman,
was very prompt in solving the mystery of this unheard-of political
combination; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>why should two sets of giavours combine with the
true believers, against a third?</p>
<p>The reason seemed plain enough to him. The French giavours had a new
king, and since the Padi-shah is the &ldquo;Prince of Princes, and Lord
of Lords,&rdquo; in order to merit at his hands the consummation of
royalty, they had come to fight for him, bringing along England to
intercede for them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109"

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE ADMINISTRATIVE GOVERNMENT.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Although the power and authority of the sultan is
unlimited, and his sway entirely arbitrary, the disposal of affairs is
naturally consigned to various officers. The two principal of these are
the Grand Vezir, and the Sheikh-ul-Islam.</p>
<p>The Grand Vezir was formerly called Lala, or Tutor, because he was
the sole adviser to his majesty, and as he exercised the civil
functions of the executive, he was styled &ldquo;Vekili-Mutlah,&rdquo;
or vicar absolute. He therefore enjoyed all the rights and immunities
of his imperial master&mdash;to the entire control of property and life
itself.</p>
<p>He used to head the army in time of war; make all appointments to
office; give audiences to the foreign ambassadors, receive and answer
their memorials; and he only, of all the ministers of the realm, had
free access to the royal presence. As he was amenable to no tribunal,
his only forfeit being his own <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb110"
href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>head, and his worldly
possessions, it was his policy to render the person of the sultan
inapproachable&mdash;between whom and his people, a mystic veil seemed
ever to depend. By degrees, the monarch, who should have been the
father of his people, removed from all intercourse with his subjects,
became only the shrine of their superstitious devotions, the deity of
their worship, the proxy of Allah; while the real administrator of the
realm, was the selfish, ambitious, scheming, and blood-thirsty Grand
Vezir. Even on Fridays, as his majesty appeared in public on his way to
the mosque, he was so surrounded by pomp and royal pageantry, as to be
almost invisible. But since the promulgation of the Tanzimat or
reformation, an entire change has been effected in the administrative
department, and a substantial check imposed upon the Grand Vezir, whose
former prerogatives and immunities have been much curtailed.</p>
<p>There is now a council attached to each department, which
deliberates upon the various measures proposed. A grand national
council, established on a somewhat European system, called the
Medjlissi-Wala, or senate, composed of the dignitaries and notables of
the nation, and presided over by a Reiss or chief of its own, controls
the affairs of the nation in general. Its duties are to prepare the
laws; establish or revise the basis of the taxation; regulate
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>the revenues and expenditure of the government;
to draft the instructions for the governors of the provinces; to try
all treasonable acts and crimes committed against the state; to correct
the abuses of the functionaries; to attend to the complaints of
citizens brought against the different agents or authorities; to draw
up sentences for criminals, which are either maintained or modified by
his majesty, etc. etc.,</p>
<p>There is another council called the Medjlissi-Khass, or special
council, which, being composed of the ministers of the different
departments, may be termed a cabinet, or privy council.</p>
<p>The Grand Vezir, as prime minister, presides over this. These two
councils together, constitute what is termed and generally known as the
Baabu-Aali, or the Sublime Porte.</p>
<p>Baab is the Arabic word for gate, or <i>porte</i> in French. Ever
since Mordecai sat in the king&rsquo;s gate, and perhaps long before
his time, all the places of public administration in the East, have
been designated by this term. For instance, Baab&#363;-Sheik-ul-Islam,
is the Superior Court; Baab&#363;-Serasker, the war department, and in
contradistinction to all the other courts or departments, the
government of the Ottoman empire is denominated the Baab&#363;-Aali, or
the supreme gate or court; a term of similar significance, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name="pb112">112</a>]</span>with
the Court of St. James, the Tuileries, or the Government at
Washington.</p>
<p>Thus it will be perceived, that the original autocratic government
has now been reduced into a form of bureaucracy.</p>
<p>The vast empire of Turkey, partaking of the territories of no less
than three continents, is divided into thirty-seven Ayalets or
provinces; each Ayalet being sub-divided into Livas or counties; and
each Liva into Kazas or townships. These provinces, counties, and
townships, are respectively governed by Valis, Kaimakams, and
M&uuml;dirs.</p>
<p>The governors, etc., of these provinces, formerly enjoyed in their
respective domains the same absolute authority as the Grand Vezir, and
answered with the same forfeiture of their heads and property for their
misdemeanors. But of late years, the same check has also been put upon
their powers, as in the central government, by the establishment of
councils, &amp;c.</p>
<p>All the ministers and governors of Provinces are now appointed by
the sultan, and the secondary places are filled by the appointment of
the Grand Vezir.</p>
<p>When his majesty designs to elevate a person <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e1855" title="Source: o">to</span> the office of minister of the
realm, one of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113"
name="pb113">113</a>]</span>chamberlains of the palace proceeds to
summon the individual to the royal presence, where he is invested in
his new office by the bestowal of the Nishani-M&uuml;shir or the badge
of rank in brilliants, which is suspended around the neck; and an
Irad&eacute; or Edict is granted him by the Sultan. He then proceeds
with much pomp and ceremony to the Porte, where he is immediately
recognized, according to the royal commands. He is met at the foot of
the stairway by the Grand Vezir in person, who bows to the edict
presented to him by the chamberlain with as much reverence as if it
were his royal master himself. Holding the document over his head, the
viceroy enters the grand council chamber, where he reads it in a loud
voice, and the ceremony is concluded by an extempore prayer, offered by
the mufty of the council&mdash;and the new minister is conducted to his
<i>gate</i>, or his own department.</p>
<p>When they are deposed from office, the royal chamberlain appears,
demanding the <i>Nishan</i> which is immediately relinquished.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The policy of the government has hitherto been
<i>centralization</i>, that is, to draw the mass of the people from the
frontiers to a common centre, in order the more readily to suppress any
rebellion; and by depopulating the borders, to prevent the approach of
foreign invasion.</p>
<p>Besides, even while consigning the inhabitants of the provinces to
the arbitrary control of the governors, a certain degree of awe and
ready submission might be inspired towards the central government,
which could, at pleasure and option punish, with one fell blow, the
very ruler who was regarded as omnipotent in his own territories.</p>
<p>Also, it was with ulterior designs, that such a degree of laxity was
tolerated. The distant and provincial authorities, in grasping all
within their reach, and oppressing the people under their control, were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>able to amass great possessions for themselves;
but they were amenable to the supreme power, which availed itself of
its prerogatives to judge and condemn, upon the slightest accusation,
and to confiscate and appropriate the spoils, with the semblance of
justice itself&mdash;as if avenging the wrongs of an injured
population.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, there was often an assumption of independence in
many of the provincial authorities, who succeeded in maintaining the
dignity of D&eacute;r&eacute;-Beys or Feudal Barons, such as
Tchapan-Oghlou, Tepelene, and Mehmed Aali.</p>
<p>The consequence has been, that as you receded from the seat of
government over the vast tracts of territory, the very limited internal
communications, combined with the independence and rapacity of the
governors of the distant provinces, produced anarchy, misrule and
misery, in frightful ratio. Some amelioration has been attempted of
late by the Tanzimat or reformation, and the establishing of roads and
post-offices, councils, &amp;c.; but the spirit of centralization still
pervades with all its legitimate evils.</p>
<p>Another equally pernicious error in their policy, was the idea that
it was better to employ the heads and hands of the people in foreign
wars, with the view to keep them constantly occupied, and to maintain a
military ardor. Although this system contributed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>vastly to the extension of the empire, yet sad
experience has developed its injurious effects. For constant
acquisitions so enlarged their dominions and inflated the soldiery,
that the very sultan began to tremble on his throne, until the
destruction of the janissaries became indispensable for the
preservation of the empire.</p>
<p>This famous military body was created in the reign of Sultan Mourad,
the son and successor of Orkhan; and it was notorious for many
centuries, till they were at last destroyed by Mahmoud, the father of
the present sultan.</p>
<p>The janissaries are so interwoven with the past and present history
of Turkey, that it does not seem amiss to give here a slight sketch of
their origin and downfall. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h2 class="main">HISTORY OF THE JANISSARIES.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Janissaries were first instituted for the
protection of the throne and person of the sultan; the army being then
composed of the victorious Turkomans, who had become turbulent, and
were ready to take the reins of government into their own hands. A new
militia was consequently instituted by Mourad, composed of young
prisoners of war, who were brought up in the Moslem faith: and, in
contradistinction to the existing army, were denominated Yeni-tcheri,
or new soldiers.</p>
<p>With the design of giving more solemnity to the new order, the
founder resorted to the aid of religion, and they were blessed by a
famous sheikh, Hadji-Bektash,<a class="noteref" id="xd25e1909src" href=
"#xd25e1909" name="xd25e1909src">1</a> who extending his arms over the
troops, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118" name=
"pb118">118</a>]</span>invoked the blessing of Allah, and predicted
their future victories, pronouncing these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let them be called Yeni-tcheries. May their countenance ever
be bright! their hand victorious! their sword keen! May their spear
always hang over the head of their enemies, and wheresoever they go,
may they return with a white face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their uniform consisted of loose trousers, and long, flowing robes,
tucked up. Their head-gear, when in full dress, was very peculiar. A
round cap of grey felt, with a long piece of the same hanging behind,
in commemoration of the loose sleeve of the saint, which was suspended
over their heads when he extended his arms to bless their
institution.</p>
<p>They were armed with sabres, scimitars, pistols, yataghans, muskets,
constituting, as it were, a peripatetic model arsenal.</p>
<p>Their mode of warfare was quite primitive; each fighting on his own
responsibility.</p>
<p>From their earliest years, these Christian slaves snatched from the
bosom of their families, were inured to all sorts of hardships, and to
perfect resignation to the will of their superiors. They were
diligently trained in the art of war, and every trace of their parents
and native country being obliterated from their minds, their only aim
was to promote the interest and glory of their lord and sultan, and
they were, for many centuries, justly distinguished for the excellence
of their discipline, and for their indomitable courage.</p>
<p>But, owing to their constant successes, they at last began to
consider themselves invincible, and by degrees becoming insolent,
respected neither the laws nor even the sultan himself. They thus
turned <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>that power, which was originally the defence and
glory of the country, to its ruin and destruction; and many were the
sultans who fell victims to their audacity and rebellion.</p>
<p>Sultan Selim III., in his attempt to reform them, was sacrificed to
their fury.</p>
<p>They were, in reality, the ruling power in the country: dethroning
sultans, and taking off the heads of ministers at their will. They were
upheld in all their excesses by the people, from a dread of their
vengeance, many of whom, from motives of personal safety, even enlisted
as honorary members of their corps. For, even the assassin could find a
secure asylum in their barracks, from which no power or authority could
claim him.</p>
<p>Nothing was sacred in their estimation; families dared not to
venture abroad without a janissary escort; and, on this account, the
different foreign embassies were always accommodated with two or three
of their number, which custom is still in vogue; though Kavasses, or
Turkish police officers, have been substituted for the janissaries of
former times.</p>
<p>Even the royal harem was not safe from them, and neither life nor
property were secure from their depredations.</p>
<p>Besides their regular rations, their pay was at the rate of from one
asper to twenty, according to their <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb121" href="#pb121" name="pb121">121</a>]</span>rank, per day. An
asper was, at that time, equal to one cent of Federal money. But they
had various ways of increasing their personal revenues.</p>
<p>They assumed a peculiar style of taxing the peaceable citizens, by
carelessly tossing their handkerchiefs at them, with an intimation that
their pockets needed replenishing, and none dared to return the
handkerchief without a tribute tied in one of its corners.</p>
<p>Those who were stationed in the city as metropolitan guards,
generally contrived to amass a quantity of mud before the guardhouse,
which they would ask all the rayahs who passed by, either to sweep
away, or contribute something for its removal.</p>
<p>The day of their revolt was most memorable, and our own janissary
boatman coolly put the number and mark of his regiment upon the
street-door of our residence, as an intimation to his comrades that the
house was already appropriated by one of the brotherhood.</p>
<p>Assassination was a matter of frequent occurrence in those days. The
father of the writer once narrowly escaped with his life.</p>
<p>He happened to be passing by a shop, where a janissary was examining
a yataghan with a view of purchasing it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb122" href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; cried the janissary, to him, &ldquo;come here, I
want to test this blade on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew the character of those villains too well to suppose that the
rascal was joking&mdash;as a forlorn hope, he indifferently remarked,
&ldquo;that it would be hardly worth the while to try such an exquisite
blade on my old tottering body,&rdquo; at the same time suggesting,
that it would be better for his excellency to accept the sword as a
gift, with the view of trying it on some worthier subject, and throwing
the money to the merchant, the old gentleman very suddenly
disappeared.</p>
<p>Imbued with the wildest fanaticism, and with all the prejudices of
ancient times, and habituated to command rather than to obey, these
janissaries constituted the most effectual barrier to all progress or
national reform.</p>
<p>Indeed, their outrageous conduct was often the principal cause of
war with foreign nations&mdash;and a stigma upon their country.</p>
<p>Any monarch, then, who appreciated the real interest of his
subjects, and could anticipate the future downfall of his country,
would be impelled to annihilate this scourge.</p>
<p>Eternal gratitude is due to the illustrious Mahmoud, who at last,
accomplished this task. A man of remarkable energy and discernment,
more inspired <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>with the spirit of civilization and modern
reform than any of his predecessors; with a determination and
perseverance unparalleled in the history of his country, Mahmoud
effected this <i lang="fr">coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i>, and has justly
been designated of &ldquo;Glorious memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He first gained over to himself the renowned H&uuml;ssein Pasha, who
was then the Agha or chief of the janissaries; then Kara-Jehennem or
Black-Hell, the chief of the artillery, and Bostangy-Bashi, the head of
the life-guards; with the co-operation of these personages a system of
military reform was ordered, requiring all the soldiery to be regularly
drilled, and to adopt a certain uniform better suited to military life,
than the flowing robes and cumbersome head gears they had hitherto
worn.</p>
<p>The artillery corps and the life-guards cheerfully submitted to this
order, but the janissaries considered this change of costume as an
innovation upon long established customs, and averse to any military
discipline, there arose great dissatisfaction among them; and, as
usual, they commissioned the Kool-Keahiassi, their representative, to
remonstrate with his majesty, upon whose refusal to listen to their
murmurs, they determined on rebellion.</p>
<p>Having no suspicions of their chief, H&uuml;ssein-Pasha, according
to his counsel and public proclamation, the janissaries all assembled
in their own barracks, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href=
"#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>at the great square of Et-Meydan,
nearly in the centre of the city, to be in readiness to resist any
attempt on the part of the sultan, to enforce his edict.</p>
<p>The sultan being informed of this circumstance, he, on his part,
issued a proclamation that all good Mussulmans should repair to the
holy standard of the Prophet in the court of the seraglio.</p>
<p>This standard is never brought out except in cases of great
emergency, and no Mussulman would refuse to repair to it when summoned.
Accordingly all the Mussulman citizens, the artillery and the
life-guards, who hated the janissaries, assembled at the seraglio and
proceeded in a body to the great rallying point of the rebels, where
they met with a warm reception from the barrack windows of the
janissaries, who, confident in their own sheltered position, were sure
of a glorious victory.</p>
<p>But they were soon undeceived; for, by the order of Kara-Jehennem,
two field pieces had been slily transported to the very doors of the
barracks, whose first discharge shattered the gates and prostrated
hundreds of the rebels.</p>
<p>The janissaries now desperate, rushed to seize the cannon, which
were just reloading: and had it not been for the heroic action of
Kara-Jehennem at this critical emergency, all would have been lost. The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125" name=
"pb125">125</a>]</span>brave general perceiving the nature of the
affair, and although wounded as he was in the thigh, promptly jumped
from his horse, and seizing the torch, instantly applied it to the
cannon, and thus baffling the attempts of the assailants, soon turned
the scale of fortune.</p>
<p>All resistance was now rendered futile by the barracks being set on
fire, when amidst shrieks of agony the miserable wretches were, on the
15th of June, 1826, destroyed. Many among them were allowed to effect
their escape, with the design of sparing the innocent. The most
dangerous of their number were afterwards arrested and sent to the
European castles on the Bosphorus, where their doom was sealed by the
bow-string, and thus perished this formidable scourge of the Ottoman
Empire.</p>
<p>Many censures and much opprobrium have been cast upon the memory of
Mahmoud for this act of consummate destruction. He has been stigmatized
as cruel and blood-thirsty, whereas his whole country was groaning
under a scourge of tremendous power, in the shape of an unlicensed
soldiery.</p>
<p>Day by day, the monster grew in strength, and threatened the utter
annihilation of both sovereign and people. What greater act of humanity
then, than to crush the Hydra with one fell blow.</p>
<p>By this act Mahmoud not only established his own <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>sovereign authority, but bursting, for the first
time, the bonds of barbarism, made a bold stride towards the platform
of civilization, and the fraternity of the world. But for Mahmoud,
Turkey would, perhaps, have, ere this, been only a record of the
past.</p>
<p>The army was immediately re-organized, and the soldiers were trained
in European tactics, by distinguished foreign officers.</p>
<p>They attained great distinction as infantry and artillery-men, and
still greater progress would have been made in military science, had it
not been for the intrigues of Russia, who, just at that period,
availing herself of the forlorn condition of the country, found a
favorable opportunity for declaring war.</p>
<p>The Allies of the present day, not discerning the Muscovite cunning,
were quiet spectators of the affray, and became as it were silent
partners in the shameful treaty of Adrianople, for which they have
since paid so dearly.</p>
<p>But the janissaries were not the sole barriers to the civilization
of the country. The Ulema, or the expounders of the faith, have
exercised even greater influence over the minds of the superstitious
people, through their unlimited spiritual authority. <span class=

<h2 class="main">SPIRITUAL BRANCH OF THE GOVERNMENT.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Turkey is a country where church and state are most
eminently combined. The standard of every measure or act is the Koran;
the administration of affairs, both civil and religions, must,
therefore, be in conformity with the precepts of that sacred book; but
since that book does not provide for all emergencies, and in many
instances is not even explicit, those who made the Koran their special
study have ever been consulted, and all matters referred to them for
examination and sanction.</p>
<p>The entire body of these ecclesiastics are denominated the
<span class="sc">Ulema</span>, or learned (in the Koran), and their
expositions are termed <i>Fetvas</i>. These Fetvas constitute, as it
were, the statutes of the state.</p>
<p>The sanction of these doctors in every measure being essential, each
civil tribunal is supplied with one of their number, in order that
their acts may be valid. Hence, even the Grand-Vezir, who only
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>represents the sultan in temporal matters, is
associated with the chief of the Ulema, viz., the Sheikh-ul-Islam, who,
on his part, personifies his majesty in spiritual affairs. Bearing the
title of <i>Fetvayi-Pena</i>, or the Grand Expositor, his approval is
necessary even to the measures of the great viceroy himself, for no law
can be promulgated without his sanction.</p>
<p>Considering then the importance attached to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name=
"pb129">129</a>]</span>study of the Koran, and the benefit derived from
a full knowledge of its spirit and contents, which constitute the basis
of the law and government, many have been induced to adopt it as a
profession.</p>
<p>There are no less than forty thousand of these Ulema in
Constantinople.</p>
<p>These men are of very low origin, and are generally the sons of poor
peasants. They come to Constantinople and enlist themselves as
<i>Softas</i>, or students of divinity or law, which are synonymous
terms, in one of the principal mosques, where they go through a regular
course of study.</p>
<p>They receive no salary, but are allowed one loaf of bread a day, and
partake of such food as is gratuitously distributed to the poor from
the <i>Imarets</i>, or charitable institutions, which are attached to
all the principal mosques.</p>
<p>When they are proficients in writing, they are allowed to copy the
Koran in the original Arabic, which it has hitherto been considered
sacrilege to print or translate. And by the sale of these copies they
gain a livelihood.</p>
<p>They are afterwards promoted either to the office of Imams,
officiating priests, or to that of Kadis and Mollahs, district judges,
or Muftis, or expounders of the law. The acme of their ambition is to
become either Molla-Hunkiar, chaplain to his majesty, Kazy-ul-Asker
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>chief justice, or Sheikh-ul-Islam, high pontiff
of the realm. This latter personage is considered by the Mussulmans as
an undoubted oracle in all instances.</p>
<p>Though the sultan is the head of both church and state, yet the
Sheikh-ul-Islam being appointed for life, and exempted from capital
punishment, his authority, through the superstition of the people, has
been most arbitrary, and even sometimes controlled the actions of the
executive; and it has only happened in our day, that in order to assert
the entire supremacy of the sultan, the Sheikh-ul-Islam has, for the
first time in the annals of the nation, been deposed from his sacred
office, and another substituted in his place.</p>
<p>The Ulema are not supported by the government, but by the income of
the mosques, which are largely endowed by religious devotees. Those who
are in the civil employment, receive, however, fixed salaries from the
state, in addition to their own <span class="corr" id="xd25e2076"
title="Source: ecclesiastial">ecclesiastical</span> income.</p>
<p>The real estates owned by the mosques are immense and beyond
calculation. They are called <i>Vakuf</i>, in contradistinction to
other lands of the government, termed <i>m&uuml;lk</i>. These vakuf
lands, which comprise more than two-thirds of the empire, are sold as
under a perpetual lease, with a yearly tax or rent, and all
improvements made on them are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131"
href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>considered to belong by right
to the land, and not allowed to be removed. In case of the death of a
proprietor leaving no <i>male</i> heirs, the property, with all the
improvements thereon, reverts to the mosque.</p>
<p>The documents by which these lands are held, are so carelessly
registered and transferred, that disputes are almost unavoidable. For
instance, a deed is thus drawn up, A B has purchased of C D a piece of
land, belonging to such a vakuf, said to contain <i>about</i> 156 acres
<i>more</i> or <i>less</i>; that is, it might range from 100 to 1,500
or 2,000 acres, since its limits are not fixed by any actual survey, or
specified by a map; but the boundaries are described in the most
primitive style by sensible objects, viz., an apple tree on one side, a
ditch on the other, the property of so and so on the third, and the
main road on the fourth. This system has hitherto proved most
advantageous to the vakufs; the peculiar elasticity of such indefinite
boundaries, admitting of great territorial trespass upon adjoining
lands, until they have succeeded in absorbing two-thirds of the
empire.</p>
<p>Strangers are not allowed to own these lands, nor hold them in
trust, with the view to avoid litigation with the different foreign
embassies. There has not, therefore, been hitherto any inducement to
European emigration, to the introduction of foreign capital, nor
encouragement to internal improvements. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb132" href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span></p>
<p>The mosques derive an immense revenue, both from the rents of these
estates, and the commission on sales, which is enormous; being no less
than 8 per cent. on each transfer.</p>
<p>With such a percentage, were the sale repeated fifteen times, the
original cost of the land would be doubled; so that there is an
effectual check upon land speculation. Apart from this, the vakuf
system is ruinous both to the community and to the government. If a man
wants to raise a sum of money, by mortgaging his property for three
months only, besides the customary interest of the country, which is 1
per cent., he has to bear the enormous expense of the transfer and
retransfer, which amounts, as has been said, to 6 per cent. This added
to the 3 per cent., the interest for the three months, making
altogether no less than 9 per cent. for three months! This is not all.
The natives not being allowed the privilege of borrowing foreign funds,
by mortgaging their own property, are reduced to the necessity of
resorting to their own capitalists, who usually demand 2 or 3 per cent.
a month!</p>
<p>The whole of this vakuf land, or church property, occupied and
unoccupied, pays no taxes, so that a most profitable source of revenue
is unavailable to the government.</p>
<p>The immense incomes of the vakufs are partly <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>appropriated to the erection of mosques,
hospitals, schools, fountains, baths, and other charitable
institutions; and above all to the support of the Ulema themselves. But
there is always an immense surplus, which lies dormant with previously
accumulated hoards, unless resorted to for the promotion of some of the
fanatical schemes and personal aggrandizement of the Ulema
themselves.</p>
<p>These men, thus rendered independent of the government, and
possessing unbounded influence over the minds of the superstitious
people, and being, in fact, the ultimatum of every hope and project,
have been the greatest barriers to national improvement; for,
surrounded by wealth, and themselves of the lowest origin, they attach
an undue value to worldly possessions; and trained in religious
bigotry, they resist all innovations as infringing upon their own
interests, temporal and spiritual; so that in destroying the
janissaries, and leaving the Ulema unmolested, Sultan Mahmoud did but
half the work of reform. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=

<p>Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire, though it
contains, including all its suburbs, a population of nearly a million
of inhabitants, is, owing to the system of centralization, exempt from
the direct tax, which is levied only in the provinces. Of late there
has, however, been a sort of an income tax established, requiring every
house-owner to register all contracts of rent at the Police, and pay a
fee <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>thereon of two per cent. Besides this, they have
also introduced another tax on commercial and financial transactions,
such as stamped bills, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Some of these taxes and revenues are collected by the agents of the
government on its own account; and others are farmed out at public
auction, with the view of avoiding the abuses and corruptions of the
officials; the benefit of which arrangement was illustrated, when the
custom-house was farmed out to the Armenian banker, Djez&acirc;yirly,
who bid double the amount which the treasury used to realize.</p>
<p>The expenditure of the government has usually been nearly within its
income; but of late years has exceeded it.</p>
<p>It includes the sultan&rsquo;s personal expenses, and the civil and
military list.</p>
<p>The sultan receiving a salary of $300,000 per month; the Grand Vezir
$4,000, and the others $3,000 each.</p>

<p>The deficiency in the treasury is occasioned partly by arrears of
taxes, and partly by incidental expenses, such as bank subvention,
appropriations for internal improvements, etc.</p>
<p>With the view of enabling the treasury to carry on its operations,
the government has, for the past few years, been obliged to effect a
local loan of $8,000,000, in the shape of Kayem&eacute;s, or Treasury
notes, bearing interest of 6 per cent per annum. Apart from this, it
has also contracted a foreign debt of &pound;5,000,000&mdash;these two
are the only national debts.</p>
<p>The monetary market in every country is governed by its exports and
imports. The demand in Turkey for articles of foreign produce, having
gradually exceeded its former imports, the balance of trade has been
against the country, and a drain of specie has been the natural
consequence. Apart from this, the payment of the Russian indemnities,
having forced the government to demonetize its currency, the rate of
exchange became very fluctuating, and a fit subject to financial
operators; so that affairs assumed a frightful aspect.</p>
<p>To remedy this evil, the government was advised to establish a Bank,
in order to keep the foreign exchange at a more uniform par value; this
subvention has cost the government on an average $1,000,000
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>per annum; jet without any good success, for it
only served to enrich a few individuals, who were intrusted with its
management, without benefiting the country in general, and involved the
national treasury in greater difficulty. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</ul>
<p>Every division comprises, three regiments of foot, two of horse, and
one of artillery, with 32 guns, the whole amounting to 30,000 men.</p>
<p>The soldiers in active service are called <i>Nizam</i>, and those in
reserve, <i>Redif</i>. They are raised by conscription, and formerly
used to serve all their lifetime, or as long as they were able, but by
a commendable measure recently introduced by Riza Pasha, a military
reform has been effected, by which they are now relieved at the end of
five years, when they go to their respective homes, subject however, to
certain military duties at stated times. By this measure, Turkey has
been enabled to raise a reserve of no less than 400,000 Redifs.</p>
<p>Both Nizams and Redifs are divided into two bodies, commanded by
Feriks (or Lieutenant Generals) and Livas (Brigadier General), and the
whole of every division by a Serdar or Field Marshal. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span></p>
<p>The entire army is subject to the orders of the Ser-Asker or the
Generalissimo, who is the minister of war.</p>
<p>The famous Omar Pasha who was one of the Serdars commanding the
Asiatic division, has lately been elevated to the post of Ser
Asker.</p>
<p>The rank and file of the Turkish army in composed of able-bodied and
well-drilled soldiers; but they are badly officered by illiterate men,
raised from the ranks, who are untarnished by modern reforms and imbued
with a due share of the popular national conceit. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is only very recently, that a military school having been
established, the army is supplied with well instructed officers, among
whom may be found many of the sons of the grandees of the empire. There
is, however, a constant jealousy between these more enlightened young
commanders, and the old veterans of the <i lang="fr">ancien
r&eacute;gime</i>; the latter regarding the former as mere upstarts and
parvenus.</p>
<p>The Rayas, or Christian subjects have hitherto been exempt from
military service not because they are not fitted to become the
defenders of their country, equally with their Mohammedan compatriots,
but lest by coming into competition with them they should rise to high
posts in the army, and rank even above their Mussulman
subordinates.</p>
<p>The Turkish navy is comprised thus:</p>

<p>Many of the Turkish vessels of war are noble specimens of naval
architecture. For ever since the beautiful models built by Ekford and
his successors, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142"
name="pb142">142</a>]</span>Rhodes and Beeves, have floated upon their
waters, a wonderful impetus has been given to the navy of the
Osmanlis&mdash;and the prow of almost every vessel bears the impress of
American ingenuity.</p>
<p>Magnificent men of war, vessels of the line, frigates, sloops,
brigs, schooners, and cutters lie all along the Bosphorus, fully manned
and equipped. But so seldom are they in action, or so rarely do they
sail beyond the &ldquo;ocean stream,&rdquo; that the men are utterly
without the incitement of any real engagements, and unused to rougher
seas&mdash;so that if, perchance, they are called into active service,
more than half of them are confined to their hammocks.</p>
<p>Thus the lamentable occurrence at Sinope may be accounted for; the
squadron having been obliged to anchor there on its way to Batoum,
because nearly all the sailors were sea-sick.</p>
<p>The officers themselves are illiterate, and ignorant of the science
of navigation.</p>
<p>It is true that some few have been educated in the British navy, who
are now distinguished in the Turkish marine&mdash;and it is to be hoped
that many of the scholars of the new naval academy will hereafter
elevate the character of their nation on the seas; though there are not
the same incentives to maritime emulation as exist in England and
America, or even in France. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href=

<p>The Osmanlis, having no commercial marine except their own few
coasters&mdash;the whole foreign, and great part of the internal trade,
is carried on by 35,000 foreign vessels; whose aggregate tonnage
amounts to 5,000,000 annually, and they are admitted to her ports at
small charges.</p>
<p>The tariff of Turkey is but nominal; being only three per cent. on
all exports, and two per cent. additional as consumptive
duty&mdash;making altogether, five per cent. on their value.</p>
<p>This free-trade principle, is not, however, purely from liberal
motives, but the result of foreign compulsion, and their own ignorance
of political <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href="#pb145" name=
"pb145">145</a>]</span>economy. For, in their anxiety to counterbalance
the deficiencies of the treasury, caused by unjust treaties extorted
from them by foreign powers, they have imposed a duty of no less than
thirteen per cent. on all their produce or exports, so that, when the
governmental tithe upon the raw material, the various other direct and
indirect taxes on the same, and the onerous export duty are together
taken into consideration, the cost of the produce is, in effect, raised
to about 30 or 35 per cent. above its original value.</p>
<p>Apart from this, if sheet iron, which is imported from England, and
upon which the usual duty of 5 per cent. is already levied, be
manufactured into stove pipes, or any other form, it is considered as
<i>home produce</i>, and a new duty of 13 per cent. collected
thereon!</p>
<p>The tariff is regulated every seven years, and the value of the
different articles is determined by a commission of merchants
representing the different nations, each of whom endeavors to maintain
his own interest. One of these gentlemen exultingly boasted, that his
own fortune was made, as he had succeeded in establishing a low
valuation on a certain article in which he dealt very largely.</p>
<p>America has hitherto had no representative in this body, though her
commerce has, especially of late, been rapidly increasing with this
part of the world. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146"
name="pb146">146</a>]</span>It has only been through ignorance of the
country and its resources, that American enterprise has made so little
progress in the East, or been confined to the interposition of English
and other houses.</p>

community? Let the following table of Exports and Imports speak for

<p>If, then, such is the variety of items, more than sufficient to
command the attention of any mercantile community, it is somewhat
astonishing that the Americans should not have been attracted to the
advantages to be derived from an interchange of commerce, so jealous as
they are of commercial supremacy.</p>
<p>The territory is immense, teeming with undeveloped resources; the
population over 35 millions of souls to be supplied with the
necessities, and many <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href=
"#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>of the superfluities of life.
England and France have fought for the freedom of <i>this</i> commerce,
America may spread her sails unstained by the blood of her citizens,
and be wafted into ports, where treasures and profit are in greater
profusion than either in China or Japan.</p>
<p>War having ceased, and so many new and salutary reforms soon to be
introduced, commerce and all the arts of peace and prosperity will
flourish with renewed vigor upon the Turkish soil. Internal
improvements are already projected and in progress, demanding the
genius and ingenuity of foreign climes. While then, England and France
are eagerly watching every opening, shall America remain blindfolded
and indifferent?&mdash;a country so productive of men of the rarest
energy and perseverance, so full of the brightest Yankee notions, and
the most curious and useful specimens of mechanical art and
manufactures! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">JURISPRUDENCE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Europe and America disputes often involve a process
of tedious litigation. It is not so in Turkey; although the Koran and
its voluminous commentaries decide every case &ldquo;from a point of
faith to a right of gutter,&rdquo; yet the form of trial is so simple
that it becomes quite expeditious. For all Turkish jurisprudence may be
condensed into these two principles, viz.,</p>
<p>1st. In every case of litigation the testimony of two witnesses is
required of the plaintiff, and</p>
<p>2d. In default of witnesses an oath is administered to the defendant
as the only alternative.</p>
<p>No written document, except judicial, is considered valid, or
recognized by the courts, unless it be substantiated by two
witnesses.</p>
<p>For instance, a banker had advanced to the treasury about $30,000 on
account of a certain pasha, who farmed a province from the government.
Before <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>the year was out the pasha died, and the court
of chancery taking charge of the estate of the deceased, it became
necessary to examine and settle the banker&rsquo;s account current with
the defunct. On examination it was found that the banker had paid to
the treasury the above mentioned sum in thirty-three different
installments, and received from the deceased only $18,000; so that
there was a balance due the banker of $12,000.</p>
<p>But the court of chancery would not recognize the disbursements of
the banker in behalf of the deceased, unless each of the installments
made by the banker to the government could be substantiated by two
witnesses; thus requiring no less than sixty-six witnesses for the
case. It was in vain the banker produced the vouchers of the government
regularly signed and sealed by the proper authorities. The judges would
admit nothing but the requisite witnesses, and in default of such
witnesses claimed from the banker the $18,000, the receipt of which was
avowed by him, and consequently due to the heirs.</p>
<p>Nor is this mode of justice, primitive as it is, ever used with
impartiality.</p>
<p>Witnesses are never subp&oelig;naed by the courts, and no oath is
required of them for the truth of their depositions; also on account of
the spirit of fanatical animosity which exists mutually between the
Christians <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>and Mohammedans, no unbiased testimony is to be
procured. Indeed, formerly, the Christians were not even allowed to
appear as witnesses.</p>
<p>The judges themselves being men of low birth and grovelling
principles, only hold their offices as sources of personal emolument,
as the wealth of various of these functionaries fully attests. The late
Sheikh-ul Islam, at his death, left the sultan, by bequest, nearly a
million of dollars!</p>
<p>Although strictly prohibited by the Koran, they are in the constant
habit of receiving bribes to any amount; notwithstanding the precepts
of their religion, which are ever and anon held up as barriers to all
reform, they are so corrupted, that their consciences are immediately
lulled, whenever the requisite bonus is slily slipped under the
cushions on which they sit, and the testimony of hired witnesses is
then winked at by them, and even supported, as their interest may
demand.</p>
<p>The only qualification requisite for a witness to appear before
these courts of justice, is to be omniscient, and never to utter the
fatal word <i>Bilmem</i>, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>When conflicting interests occur, which induce the judges to take
side against the witnesses&mdash;and such occasions are by no means
rare, since justice is not only put up at auction, but a single
recommendation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>from a grandee suffices to turn the
scale&mdash;the scene is truly farcical, and its sketch worthy of the
pen of Dickens himself.</p>
<p>The Kadis adopt a singular method to disqualify the testimony. The
questions which are put in the cross-examination, are not only entirely
irrelevant to the subject matter in dispute, but would even puzzle the
&ldquo;cutest Yankee&rdquo; how to answer. Their object is to
disqualify the testimony by questions, no matter how ridiculous, but by
which the witnesses will be forced at last to utter the ominous word
<i>Bilmem</i>&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>With a view to ascertain whether the witnesses are well acquainted
with the party in whose behalf they are testifying, they are asked,
&ldquo;who was the grandfather of the plaintiff?&rdquo; The usual and
formal answer in such cases is, &ldquo;Abraham,&rdquo; meaning the old
Patriarch. &ldquo;His great grandfather?&rdquo; &ldquo;Adam,&rdquo;
beyond whom he (the plaintiff), is not supposed to have any
ancestors.</p>
<p>On a certain occasion, a judge being very anxious to defeat the
testimony of a clever witness, after various ingenious interrogatories,
made the quaint inquiry, &ldquo;who married Adam and Eve?&rdquo; To
which the witness unhesitatingly replied, not, as it may be supposed,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo;&mdash;oh no, not so stupid as
that&mdash;but, &ldquo;<i>I was not invited to the
wedding.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a maxim of the government and a profitable <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>one
to its employ&eacute;s, that in the administration of justice, a speedy
infliction of punishment, even though unjust, was more desirable than a
tedious course of litigation, as the fear and awe thus infused into the
hearts of the people, rendered them submissive to the most irrational
commands, and terrified the mass into a dread of infringing the laws,
although some few might suffer unjustly.</p>
<p>This principle, though nominally abandoned by the government, is
still maintained by the judiciary; therefore, no pleading by lawyers is
allowed, and the sentence is passed with all possible dispatch, or
deferred at pleasure, as circumstances may require.</p>
<p>The whole of Turkey is divided into two separate judicial districts,
viz., Anadolou, and Roumely, or Asia and Europe, and there is a
Kazi-ul-Asker, or chief justice, appointed to each district, who
preside over their respective courts.</p>
<p>There, is, however, a supreme court called, Arz-Odassi, or court of
appeals, where the Grand Vezir and the Grand Mufty conjointly preside,
and there all cases, when appealed, are heard; but the sentences are
seldom reversed, as they wish to preserve the decisions of the
judiciary courts inviolable. When the injustice is too gross and
palpable, a new Ilam or sentence is granted by this court, without any
allusion to prior proceedings. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154"
href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is true that the people have the right to appeal to his majesty
for redress, but as they are invariably referred to this court for
reconsideration, justice is seldom rendered to the appellants.</p>
<p>Foreigners are not tried before these courts. If the litigation is
between themselves, their cases are tried and settled by their
legations; but if with the natives, they are referred to a special
court of the ministry of commerce, called Medjlissy-Tidjaret, composed
of various merchants both natives and foreigners, and presided over by
the Minister of Commerce, or his deputy.</p>
<p>The code by which this body pretends to be governed, is the
&ldquo;Code de Commerce&rdquo; of Napoleon. How equitably it is applied
by them, may easily be perceived.</p>
<p>Imagine some twenty-five or thirty merchants, of different nations
and tongues, assembled together in the character of jurors, who not
only do not understand a word or syllable that is uttered in their
hearing, but often do not even possess the means of communicating their
ideas to each other.</p>
<p>The affair brought before them, being unintelligible to most of
them, it is generally conducted by the government officials, or some of
the members who are fortunate enough to know something of the language,
and their decisions imparted to the passive <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>members, who usually give their sanction, taking
it for granted that all is right. The consequence is, that if one of
the litigants is so happy as to secure the good will and patronage of
an acting member, he is sure to come off successfully, no matter how
bad his case.</p>
<p>This body, like the other Turkish courts, admits not the pleading by
lawyers, for a good and simple reason, that its members being men of
business, and ignorant of law and legality, prefer to be governed by
their own judgment, and constitute themselves at once, judge, jury, and
prosecutors.</p>
<p>The interpreters of the foreign legations, are, however, required by
treaty to be present, who not only interpret for the parties, but are
bound to defend and protect their fellow citizens, to the best of their
ability, and report thereupon to their respective ambassadors. It is to
be regretted that the services of these individuals are not always
disinterested. Policy sometimes inclines them to side with this
serio-comical court, for the sake of keeping on good terms with the
officials and its members, and thus maintaining their own reputations
at the Porte as emissaries of foreign lands; while at the same time a
good <span class="corr" id="xd25e2935" title=
"Source: oportunity">opportunity</span> is offered them for the
gratification of any personal pique or prejudice against their clients;
so that a foreigner may either suffer injustice, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>or
be injurious to the people of the country, without the knowledge of his
own ambassador. How true, then, the observation of Lord <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e2940" title="Source: Stradford">Stratford</span>, that
&ldquo;the very atmosphere of Turkey is impregnated with
venality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The costs of lawsuits are always defrayed by the gainer of the
cause, as he is supposed to be better able to afford such expenses; but
the evident design is to induce people to go to law, since justice is
set aside, and every facility afforded by the suborning of witnesses.
Even the sentences are so carelessly, nay designedly worded, that at
any time flaws may be discovered, and a new trial demanded.</p>
<p>The equity of making the gainer of the cause pay the costs, was
ludicrously illustrated in the case of an Arnavout or Albanian, who was
accused of stealing a gimlet. When in the presence of the Kadi, he
pleaded not guilty. The plaintiff, according to law, was required to
substantiate his accusation, by producing two witnesses. The man was in
a dilemma, for he had no witnesses to produce; but, as usual, he was
relieved from the anxiety, by the prompt offer of those harpies, who
linger about <i>mehkemes</i>, or courts of justice, and tender their
benevolent services in such emergencies, for certain remuneration.</p>
<p>Moderate as was their demand, the trifling claim <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>not
justifying much extra expense, he modestly declined availing himself of
this privilege, and pleaded to have no witnesses. The only alternative
then for the kadi was to administer the oath to the defendant; which
was unhesitatingly complied with; for the Arnavouts are generally noted
for their pliable consciences. Thus having been duly sworn, our hero
was pronounced the happy gainer of the cause, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>requested to pay only the costs, which were ten
times more than the value of the article in question.</p>
<p>The Arnavout being somewhat of a speculative genius, after due
consideration of the pros and cons, in the case, coolly put his hand in
his bosom, and producing the disputed gimlet, threw it at his accuser,
saying, &ldquo;There, have your gimlet, be you the gainer of the cause,
and pay the costs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As to criminal laws, they cannot be said to exist in Turkey; for
this form of justice being based upon the principle of retaliation, or
<i>kissass</i>, the prosecution is always on account of the injured
party, and not of the government; so that the release of a criminal is
at the option of an individual. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159"

<h2 class="main">EDUCATION.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mohammed, who is the oracle on all subjects, having
declared, that &ldquo;the ink of the learned and the blood of the
martyr are equal in the sight of God,&rdquo; education is not so
entirely neglected by his followers, as is generally supposed. It may,
in one sense, be considered general; for every parent is obliged to
send his children, both male and female, to the schools which are
attached to the mosques, and supported by them. At Constantinople there
are no less than 396 mektebs, or primary free schools, attended by
22,700 children, both boys and girls. There are six other schools, for
more advanced studies, attended by 870 pupils.</p>
<p>The initiatory services to the Elif B&eacute;, literature of the
young Moslems, are very imposing. The candidate, blooming with the
roses of six short summers, is decked in his best, and in the best of
the neighbors&rsquo; too; for there is great borrowing of jewelry
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>and rich embroideries, when the parents cannot
afford to buy. The young tyro mounts a steed which vies with him in the
splendor of its caparison, and with his badge of honor, a beautiful and
glittering satchel slung over his shoulder, parades the streets. The
children of the school about to be honored by his attendance, are the
escort; and the good old <i>hodja</i>, or school-master, leads the
train, and the tune, as they wend their way, singing and chanting; the
boys and girls vociferating in full chorus, Ameen! Ameen!</p>
<p>When the children of the sultan are about to begin their literary
pursuits, the procession and rejoicings are, of course, in proportion
to the excelling importance of the royal progeny over all inferior buds
of humanity.</p>
<p>The public are thus duly notified, though the instruction of the
young sultans is by private masters.</p>
<p>The system of instruction in the Turkish schools is eminently
primitive, and the branches taught are very elementary.</p>
<p>They use neither quill nor desk, the peculiarity of the Turkish
characters requiring the stiffness of the reed; and the importance
attached to calligraphy is so great, that the paper is held on the palm
of the hand, in order to give the flexibility requisite for the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>formation of the letters. The lessons of the
children consist of spelling and writing; and the higher studies in
committing the Koran to memory. In order to understand this sacred
book, they are obliged to learn the grammar, in which proficiency is
seldom made. Hence very few, even of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>officials, especially
of the <i lang="fr">ancien r&eacute;gime</i>, can read or write
correctly, all their correspondence being performed by keatibs, or
scribes. The general deficiency of education creates a great demand for
men of this profession, whose services are needed for all sorts of
letter writing, for petitions, obligatory notes, contracts, etc. These
persons are to be found in the court-yards of the mosques, in shops and
kahv&eacute;s near the Porte, and in many other places.</p>
<p>To those who knew not how to affix their own names to any document,
a seal not only became a convenient substitute, but the universal style
of signature. All the grandees have their m&euml;ohurdar, or
seal-bearer, and the Sadrazam officiates in this capacity to the
sultan.</p>
<p>The common punishment at schools is the world renowned bastinado, or
falaka. The apparatus consists of a cylindrical piece of wood, about
five feet long, and one inch in diameter. Near the centre of this rod,
there is a loop of rope, sufficiently wide to hold both the feet of the
truant. The rod being turned the rope winds upon it, and thus secures
the feet, which are placed therein. The person is then thrown upon his
back, by the raising of the feet, upon the soles of which the blows are
applied with a cudgel by the schoolmaster. It is a rather painful
operation, as some can tell from sad experience, who, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name="pb163">163</a>]</span>like
other boys that are never naughty, had to go through with it in their
younger days.</p>
<p>The Turkish, originally Tartar, is at present composed of three
different languages, viz: Arabic, Persian, and Tartar, owing to the
different people with whom the Turcomans came in contact. The Koran
being their fundamental study, the Arabic has become the basis of the
language, as the Latin is of the European dialects.</p>
<p>It is written from right to left, like all other Oriental languages,
with the exception of the Armenian.</p>
<p>The Turkish has no capitals or Roman letters, but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>consists of italics&mdash;or in other words, the
written and printed characters have the same forms, nor have they any
punctuation. Their calligraphy may be divided into five different
styles.</p>
<p>The <i>Rika</i>, or ordinary hand-writing, the same being used for
printing.</p>
<p><i>S&uuml;l&uuml;s</i>, or enlarged writing, is used for
inscriptions, title-pages, or the headings of chapters.</p>
<p><i>Divany</i>, or the court script, which is an ornamental style of
writing, and only used at the Porte for firmans, or edicts.</p>
<p><i>Taalik</i>, or the Persian letters, is used in the judiciary
courts, and for poetry.</p>
<p><i>Siyakat</i>, or Turkish hieroglyphics, is only used for treasury
bonds.</p>
<p>The Turkish language is, in itself, most copious and expressive,
euphonious in sound, and capable of the greatest variety of expression,
and is well adapted to the composition of poetry. Although the Osmanlis
formerly possessed but little mathematical, philosophical, or
scientific learning, the Muses have never denied their inspiration to
them. Foreign literature has been much in vogue in latter times, and
many translations have been made into Turkish. The languages of Europe
are also cultivated to some extent, and many are now to be found at the
Porte, who speak the French and English quite fluently. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span></p>
<p>The present sultan has done much to elevate the system of public
instruction in his dominions. He has ordained a council to superintend
all educational affairs, and also has commenced the erection of a
magnificent public university, opposite the mosque of St. Sophia.</p>
<p>There exist already, the school of the mosque of Ahmed, that of
Suleiman, and one founded by the late Valid&eacute; Sultan, for the
education of the young candidates for public offices. There are, also,
the medical, normal, and naval schools, and last of all, the
agricultural school at San Stefano, the direction of which was, once
upon a time, given to the celebrated <i>Turkey Jim</i>, of South
Carolina.</p>
<p>The sultan himself is present at the examinations of these various
colleges, with his retinue of Ulema, Ministers, and Pashas; his majesty
even propounds questions to the pupils, encouraging them by his
gracious condescension of manner.</p>
<p>There are as many as 80,000 books in the public libraries, written
or printed in the different Oriental dialects, Arabic, Persian, and
Turkish. These works treat of history, science, and theology; also
<span lang="fr">belles-lettres</span>, and good breeding, on which last
subject, the Osmanlis are extremely punctilious. The young men, and
even children, are exceedingly simple and unpretending, but at the same
time, intelligent and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>polite in their demeanor. They
maintain a remarkable gravity of deportment, and in the absence of
their fathers, exercise the prerogatives of hospitality, with all the
dignity of the patriarchs themselves.</p>
<p>There are now twenty-one different newspapers and periodicals in the
country, viz. two Turkish, eight Armenian, three Greek, five French,
two Italian, and one Jewish. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">MEDICINE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Although the ancient Arabs were celebrated for their
medical knowledge, the Osmanlis have only of late years made some
advances in the study of medicine.</p>
<p>They are most credulous and superstitious in their notions upon this
subject, and ready to follow the advice of any empiric in the healing
art. They seem to know two diseases peculiar to themselves; one they
call Gelinjik, and the other Yelanjik. The first is used in a
comprehensive universality and signifies almost any ailment; the second
is applied to erysipelas and nervous pains in the face.</p>
<p>The art of curing the Gelinjik has long been possessed by a single
family, and descended in hereditary succession from one to another of
its members. There is a certain Meriem Kadun of this profession, who
once had the good fortune to cure the present sultan, with some of the
mysterious red nectar, which is the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>principal medicine
administered for this malady. She has ever since had abundant practice
in the royal palace and everywhere else; and the famous Yelanjikgee has
a far-famed reputation.</p>
<p>A particular class of Emirs, or the descendants of Fatima, the
daughter of Mohammed, are supposed to possess the virtue of healing the
nervous diseases of the face called Yelanjik. They wear green turbans,
repeat certain prayers over the patient, and are supposed to possess a
charm in their fingers&rsquo; ends. The Emir lays his thumb on his
nose, breathes upon the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href=
"#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>extended fingers, then lays it
upon the forehead of the patient, and pressing upon the nerves of the
face, utters a short prayer. Thus he often succeeds in dispelling the
malady in a few minutes&mdash;whether by his own medical skill or by
the credulity of his superstitious patients, may be questioned. Strange
to say, their only belief is, that when a cure is not effected, it is
not because of the inefficacy of the charmed fingers, but the disease
was not genuine Yelanjik, and therefore the holy Emir could not cure
it. When any disease fails to be cured by either of these characters,
the Gelinjikgee and Yelanjikgee, then in despair the other disciples of
the healing art are summoned, of whom there is no scarcity in
Constantinople, where the last comer is generally patronized, until
some new pretender succeeds him.</p>
<p>A person once exceedingly ill of typhus fever, called in one of
these medical gentlemen, who, although he considered the case quite
hopeless, prescribed for his patient and took his leave. The next day,
in passing by, he inquired of a servant at the door if his master was
not dead. &ldquo;Dead? no. He is much better.&rdquo; Whereupon the
doctor proceeded up stairs to obtain the solution of this miracle.
&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said the convalescent, &ldquo;I was consumed with
thirst, and I drank a pailful of the juice of pickled cabbage.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span></p>
<p>Wonderful! quoth the doctor&mdash;and out came the tablets,
whereupon was inscribed, &ldquo;Cured of typhus fever, Mehemed Agha, an
upholsterer, by drinking a pailful of pickled cabbage juice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Soon after the worthy doctor was called to another patient, a
Yaghlikgee, or dealer in embroidered handkerchiefs, suffering from the
same malady. He forthwith prescribed &ldquo;<i>a pailful of pickled
cabbage juice</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On calling the next day to congratulate his patient on his recovery,
he was astonished to be told, the man was dead!</p>
<p>The Oriental Esculapius, in his bewilderment as to these phenomena,
came to the safe conclusion, and duly noted it in his memoranda, that,
&ldquo;Although in cases of typhus fever, <i>pickled cabbage juice</i>
is an efficient remedy, it is not, however, to be used unless <i>the
patient be by profession an upholsterer</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fortunately for the community, this branch of science is improving
in Turkey, and there are numerous graduates from the medical college,
who are employed in the army, and by the inhabitants in general.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The etiquettes and punctilious ceremonies of society
were doubtless unknown in the primitive condition of our race.</p>
<p>Modern civilization has put the world into fetters with its laws and
by-laws, which seem the result of some secret combination, as they are
generally known only to the initiated, while the less fortunate mass of
the communities become the laughing-stock of these wiseacres.</p>
<p>The true politeness and generosity which spring from good feeling
and common-sense, are little regarded by the aristocracy of society,
unless you have the open sesame to their doors, which is nothing less
than an entire conformity to their pre-conceived ideas.</p>
<p>A certain air and style, only perceivable to the critics themselves,
is to be maintained; a certain contour of costume rigorously to be
adopted, whether <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172"
name="pb172">172</a>]</span>agreeable to the wearer or not&mdash;an
unvaried and monotonous similarity must pervade the whole world, or
those venturing to differ, must suffer not only an exclusion from the
company of very agreeable people (barring their prejudices), but an
absolute persecution of ill-sounding epithets&mdash;such as vulgar,
conceited, independent, and even the moral character is often
libelled.</p>
<p>You must not attend the church of the Rev. &mdash;&mdash;, unless
your hat is black as a stove-pipe, and with a rim of approved
dimensions. The fastidious ladies of upper-tendom show symptoms of
nervous agitation, as you unwittingly mount their steps in your native
head-gear, which may chance to be a sombrero, or a Turkish
fess&mdash;what if a <span class="sc">TURBAN</span>!</p>
<p>The only occasion on which a foreigner might be permitted to appear
in his own every-day clothes, would be at some fancy ball, as if in
masquerade. All this may do among themselves, but why attempt to
renovate the habits of a life-time in others. Indeed, the Americans are
very exacting, for when did they ever conform to any other
nation&rsquo;s mode of dress? while the moment you set foot on their
shores, you must turn American <i>in toto</i>, or you are no go.</p>
<p>The English are proverbial for their snobbism, and stiff
shirt-collars&mdash;yet in London, you may meet the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>Hindostanee in his white robes and turban, the
Turk in his fess or red cap, and many others, as they are accustomed to
be at home. Still more common is this variety in Paris, and all over
Europe.</p>
<p>Americans, English, and French, traverse the East dressed as they
like, without creating either the sensation of disgust or astonishment
in the beholders. Why, then, this illiberality in the land of freedom?
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>why force the Chinese, the moment they land,
into straight-jackets, or crown the Osmanli with a sombre stove-pipe,
the most uncouth machine, yclept the <i>hat</i>, which ever any
sensible people ventured to place in so honorable a position.</p>
<p><i lang="la">Nolens volens</i>, the Osmanli, on his arrival in the
land of &ldquo;Independence,&rdquo; must needs become a Pasha of two
tails, reversed however, as at home these emblems of rank are carried
before him; but now he becomes his own standard-bearer, parading his
honors and <i>entr&eacute;e</i> to the fashionable world, in the shape
of the time-honored dress coat.</p>
<p>To those who have never visited foreign lands, one would suppose,
nothing would be more entertaining than to see an exhibition of habits
and customs of other peoples.</p>
<p>But we must take the world as it is.</p>
<p>Although the manners and dress of the Orientals were, and are still,
in many respects very different from those of their western neighbors,
yet they have displayed a degree of civilization, if we may so speak,
in their toleration of others as they chanced to meet them. English,
Spanish, Italians, Magiars, Greeks, Albanians, Croats, Bulgarians,
Persians, Kurds, and Arabs, walk their streets and enter their houses
without dreaming of changing their costume, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name="pb175">175</a>]</span>or
disguising their own nationality under any garb whatever.</p>
<p>Even the European or American travellers, making half-way attempts
at external conformity to those about them, although they become
perfect caricatures, have free scope to sport the travesties they make
of themselves, and are even treated with civility; yet, judging from
appearances, no one could conceive what parts of the world might claim
the honor of their nativity.</p>
<p>Indeed, the only occasion upon which we remember the Turks to have
taken umbrage at the European costume, was some time ago, when visitors
desired to present themselves before his imperial highness, their ideas
of decency compelled them to furnish each one with a long pelisse. So
far have they yielded their prejudices, as even to adopt the European
military and undress costume, only excluding the hat; though not
without a struggle, as was exemplified when Sultan Mahmoud ordered the
janissaries to doff their cumbersome head-gear, flowing robes, and
ample trowsers.</p>
<p>But alas for the robes and turbans! the cashmere girdles, and yellow
slippers! they are rapidly passing away. The audience-hall of the Grand
Signor, is now filled with an ordinary assemblage&mdash;the sultan
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>and his minister are stripped of the mysterious
appendages of their gorgeous draperies&mdash;beneath which, there
seemed to breathe no common soul. How imposing the garb, as they were
wont to stand in the august presence, immovable, impenetrable; each
with his majesty of mien, flowing beard, and portentous silence.</p>
<p>We have seen a fac-simile of an ancient court, or, as it was scarce
thirty years ago, in the days of the father of the present sultan.</p>
<p>Mahmoud was seated on his throne upon an elevated platform; an
immense turban composed of innumerable folds of the purest and finest
white muslin covered his royal head, in the front of which was placed a
magnificent spray of brilliants; his robes of rich silk, were confined
by a girdle of Cashmere&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178"
href="#pb178" name="pb178">178</a>]</span>softest and richest fabrics,
while over his shoulders hung a magnificent pelisse, lined throughout
with the best of Russia&rsquo;s sables. Behind him stood his numerous
pages, all young, blooming, and beardless as the fairest maidens,
arrayed in robes of delicate tints.</p>
<p>The Silahdar holding his majesty&rsquo;s sword upright, stood on the
right hand, while the Haznadar, or Lord Steward, was upon the other
side of the sultan.</p>
<p>The Ak-agha, or chief of the white eunuchs, was behind the chair, an
old, woman-like man, beardless and wrinkled. In the group were the
imperial cup bearer, Kahvegee Bashi, coffee server, Kaftan-aghassi,
gentlemen of the wardrobe, etc.</p>
<p>Below the platform, and in front of the sultan, stood in respective
rank, the different ministers of the realm, all robed to the feet in
rich and varied hues, and no two turbans alike. They seemed, indeed, to
be the movers and arbitrary controllers of the destinies of a vast
nation, the secret springs which kept the machine in motion.</p>
<p>A most interesting collection of illustrative models from life, is
carefully preserved at Constantinople, called the Elbisseyi
Atik&eacute;, and exhibited at the great square of At Meydan, or the
ancient Hippodrome, near St. Sophia. It is wonderfully true to nature,
and typical of Eastern life, recalling those <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>very
characters with their various avocations, who but a few years ago were
all upon the scene, enacting the very reality of Orientalism.</p>
<p>The different grades of life, the officers under government, civil,
religious, and military, the various trades and callings, and
individuals of both sexes were formerly, each and all, designated by a
peculiar style and appearance. The janissaries were also habited in
various costumes, according to their ranks and employments.</p>
<p>Such was the past magnificence of Turkey, now rapidly losing its
former type of varied external beauty, as it merges from day to day in
the great stream of civilization. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180"

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE SULTAN AND HIS PERSONNEL.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Rousseau has wisely observed, &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">Il faut &eacute;tudier la soci&eacute;t&eacute; par les hommes, et
les hommes par la soci&eacute;t&eacute;</span>,&rdquo; and as the tone
of society in all countries is derived from the courts and the wealthy,
so also in Turkey, the sultan and his court are the model of domestic
life and its institutions.</p>
<p>Sultan Abd-ul Medjid Khan, the Padishah of the Osmanlis, or the
reigning monarch of Turkey, was born May 6th, 1822, and succeeded his
father Sultan Mahmoud, July 1st, 1839, at the age of seventeen.</p>
<p>He has a brother and a sister, both younger than himself.</p>
<p>His brother, Aziz Efendi, lives in the same palace with him, having
apartments therein for his own use and accommodation.</p>
<p>His sister Adil&eacute; Sultan, who is married to Mehmed Aali Pasha,
the ex-Grand Vezir, resides in a separate palace on the Bosphorus.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span></p>
<p>The sultan has until now had nine children, two girls and seven
boys, but none of his children will succeed him while his brother is
living; for the law of the country requires that the eldest living
<i>male</i> member of the Imperial family shall ascend the throne.</p>
<p>The ceremony of the coronation consists simply in escorting the new
sultan in a state procession, to a particular mosque at Eyoub, at the
northern extremity of the city, where he girds on the sword of state
after suitable prayers, and is thus constituted Padishah.</p>
<p>The Princes Regent of Turkey, were formerly shut up at a place
called Kafes or Cage, within the old Seraglio, where they were watched
and closely guarded, and never allowed to go abroad&mdash;with a view
to avoid intrigue or civil commotion. But Sultan Mahmoud first broke
the unsocial chains of ancient usages; his successor has nobly followed
in his father&rsquo;s footsteps, and allows his brother liberty to go
out when he wishes, but not without a formal application for
permission, which is enjoined upon him by court etiquette.</p>
<p>The two brothers differ very materially from each other, in
temperament and character. The sultan is of a mild and affable
disposition, and so willing and yielding is he on matters of state to
please his people, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183"
name="pb183">183</a>]</span>that he is more ready to be governed than
to govern. His brother, on the contrary, is very stern and passionate,
and has the same determined character as his father.</p>
<p>Abd-ul-Medjid is of medium stature, rather delicately formed. His
eyes are dark and heavy in expression, with lofty and arched eye-brows;
his beard and moustaches of a dark auburn hue, are carefully trimmed
and completely conceal the expression of his lower features.</p>
<p>His complexion is very pallid, and his whole air decidedly
<i>nonchalant</i>.</p>
<p>On all state occasions he appears in public on horseback, wearing
the national fess, ornamented with the royal aigrette in
brilliants.</p>
<p>His short Spanish cloak falls in graceful folds around his person,
the collar of which is also adorned with diamonds. In a word, his lofty
carriage and beautifully caparisoned steed quite realize the
picturesque ideas generally conceived of an Eastern monarch.</p>
<p>He never salutes any one in public or private, save by a single
glance of his eye.</p>
<p>His favorite residence is the palace of Tchiraghan on the European
shore of the Bosphorus, a few miles from the city.</p>
<p>In order to accommodate the numerous and peculiar <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span>retinue of an Osmanli sovereign, there is a
similarity in the internal arrangements of all the royal
residences.</p>
<p>These palaces, like all other Osmanli houses, are divided into two
compartments; the first is called the <i>Selamluk</i> or the place of
salutation, and is appropriated to the men; the second is the
<i>Harem</i>, which belongs exclusively to the ladies. Between these
two are the apartments of the sultan, called <i>Mabeyn</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>personnel</i> of a sultan formerly consisted of many
functionaries. Their number has of late been much reduced, though they
are still very numerous.</p>
<p>The principal honorary officer is the <i>Silahdar</i> or Imperial
sword-bearer, whose office being a sinecure, he only enters the
presence when specially summoned, or to make some official reports.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span></p>
<p>Those who are in the most constant communication with the sultan,
are his own <i>Sir-Kiatibs</i>, private secretaries, and the
<i>Mabeyngys</i>, or chamberlains, and he is always attended by one or
two of the latter, when he goes out. These gentlemen having the private
ear of his majesty, there is constant intrigue among the different
political parties to ensure their patronage, as the easiest means of
access to his sublime highness.</p>
<p>The <i>Enderoun Aghalery</i>, or <span class="corr" id="xd25e3315"
title="Source: gentleman">gentlemen</span> of the royal household, are
young men selected from among the slaves, and also from the families of
the citizens. They are trained from their earliest years to the usages
of the palace, and receive an education suited to their prospective
career. When they are fitted for attendance upon his imperial majesty,
they become <i>Itch-Oghlans</i>, or pages of the presence, and perform
the duties of cup-bearer, towel-bearer, gentlemen of the wardrobe, and
slippers, pipe and coffee bearers, ushers, etc. They are many of them
distinguished for their elegance of manner and intelligence.</p>
<p>From the rank of pages they are afterwards promoted to be
chamberlains, and often even attain the dignity of <i>M&uuml;shirs</i>,
or Ministers of State. The present Ministers Riza Pasha, and
Mehmed-Aali Pasha, the brother-in-law of the sultan, were both
Mahmoud&rsquo;s pages. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href=
"#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span></p>
<p>The <i>mutes</i> are as indispensable as any of the palace
attendants; when the Grand Vezir goes alone, or in company with the
Grand Mufty, to the Imperial chamber, all the Mabeyngys and the
Enderoun Aghalery withdraw, and the deaf mutes remain in
attendance.</p>
<p>As on no occasion, not even during a grand council, when they
deliberate with closed doors, the Osmanlis can dispense with their
attendants, mutes are always very necessary appendages to them, both at
the palace and the Porte.</p>
<p>Although they have not the sense of hearing nor the faculty of
speech, they possess a remarkable quickness of comprehension, and have
a great tact in communicating their ideas, even to the divulging of
state secrets to their intimate friends and favorites.</p>
<p>They were formerly the executioners of the palace; no reason can be
assigned for their holding such an office, unless, being deaf and dumb,
they were not qualified to hear and pity the unfortunate victims.</p>
<p>There are also generally one or two dwarfs in the royal retinue, who
are a sort of court jesters. There is one now at the palace, who became
a very distinguished character during the reign of Mahmoud.</p>
<p>On one occasion, when the sultan was in high glee, he summoned this
man of small pretensions to the harem. His majesty wishing to test his
ingenuity, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>proposed to him, that if he could kiss any one
of those girls (pointing to a group of tall and beautiful Circassian
slaves in attendance), he should have that very one for his wife.</p>
<p>At this novel and unexpected intimation, Sir Paynim raised his eyes
to survey the bewitching circle, apparently so far beyond his reach.
But such a chance could not be lost; at all hazards, he boldly advanced
to one of the fairest, and while she looked down upon him in dismay,
gave her tangible proofs of his attachment by a tremendous blow on her
stomach.</p>
<p>As she almost doubled with pain, her pigmy lover seized her around
the neck, imprinted his first kiss of love, and gained the royal prize
by this <i lang="fr">coup de main</i>.</p>
<p>At the threshold of the Mabeyn, you will meet the Enderoun Aghalery,
or the gentlemen of the household; passing by these personages, you
ascend the stairway, and enter a large hall. On all sides are many
curtained doorways, at one of which two guards are stationed. These are
the Perdegys, or curtain keepers to his majesty.</p>
<p>The peculiarity of their domestic habits, viz., the ladies occupying
separate apartments, leaves the entire Selamluk free and accessible to
all. Hence the necessity, when wishing to be retired, of having
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188" name=
"pb188">188</a>]</span>curtains suspended to the doorways, and guards
stationed to prevent the abrupt encroachment of visitors and
strangers.</p>
<p>The personal vanity of the Osmanlis is such, that no occasion is
neglected for its gratification, and munificence is always the
concomitant of rank and distinction; therefore the slightest service is
invariably compensated by a remuneration, technically called <i lang=
"tr">bakshish</i>. The <i lang="tr">keahy&#257;</i> at the landing, who
holds your cayik while you disembark, or the ostler who holds your
horse, the <i lang="tr">pabouchjy</i>, who officiously arranges your
slippers as you leave the house, with the whole household retinue of
obsequious attendants, one and all expect the customary <i lang=
"tr">bakshish</i>.</p>
<p>So universal is this practice, that the grander the establishment,
the lower are the wages of the servants, who are sure to reap so good a
harvest from the numerous visitors, that they willingly compound for
the most trifling salaries; indeed, it may justly be said, that the
grandees support each other&rsquo;s menials.</p>
<p>This system pervades all classes of the people, and even the palace
of the sultan.</p>
<p>An amusing story is told illustrative of the way in which these
Perdegys make their post available.</p>
<p>One of these guards seemed to be enjoying such extensive revenues
from his office, that he was reported to his majesty in a very
ludicrous manner. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189"
name="pb189">189</a>]</span></p>
<p>A certain wit, by name Indjyly-Tchavoush, a sort of an Oriental
Curran, occasionally used to visit the sultan; but never without paying
tribute to these keepers of the curtain.</p>
<p>Nettled at these exactions, and wishing to attract his
majesty&rsquo;s attention to the subject, he one day entered the royal
presence with a large mackerel, the commonest fish in Turkey, in his
hand, as a present. The sultan was struck with the oddity of the gift,
and supposing that the expectations of the donor could only be realized
by some royal munificence, asked, &ldquo;What he desired in
return?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only 500 lashes, sire,&rdquo; was the prompt reply. This
reply added to his majesty&rsquo;s astonishment, &ldquo;and why so
strange a request?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, since, I am obliged to <i>share</i> all your
majesty&rsquo;s gifts with your majesty&rsquo;s curtain keepers, I wish
the rogues to have their share in this also!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judging from your benevolent countenance, that you are endowed with
generous impulses, the keepers allow you to pass within the curtained
door. You are now in a large apartment, on three sides of which are
windows, with a wide Turkish sofa at the end, some two feet high from
the floor, where the sultan is seated entirely alone, with a desk and
implements of writing before him, and a long and graceful chibouk,
mounted with a splendid amber mouth-piece <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>ornamented with
diamonds, carelessly lying by his ride. He utters the simple word,
<span class="sc">Gel!</span> come! when several attendants appear as if
by magic, and stand before him with folded hands. At every command they
make the <i>temennah</i>, or Turkish salutation, which is done, not by
bending the person, and bringing their arms over their heads, as though
they were going to dive, as is often represented in theatres, but
simply by raising the right hand to the mouth, the fingers touching the
lips, then the right temple, and then carelessly dropping it down. This
temennah is performed without uttering a single word, and signifies
perfect comprehension of the royal orders.</p>
<p>An air of humility is always maintained in the presence of
superiors, and such signs of active existence, as coughing or sneezing,
are quite unallowable. The person feeling preliminary symptoms of these
actions, being obliged either to suppress them, or to withdraw from the
presence. Indeed the social etiquettes are very strict, even among
equals. Although tobacco is introduced on occasions of ceremony and
social intercourse&mdash;the chibouk and nargill&eacute; are not the
calumets of peace, but of hospitality&mdash;the disagreeable
concomitants of the weed so universal in America, are absolutely
unknown in Turkey. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191"
name="pb191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p>Spitting, then, is to the Osmanlis a most repulsive act, and their
horror may be imagined when, on a certain occasion, while in the
company of a grandee of the realm, the representative of the great
American nation (the New World), deliberately took his quid from his
pocket, and after cutting the requisite morsel, stored it carefully in
the corner of his mouth, and commenced the slow mastication so
characteristic of good tobacco chewers! The indulgence of such a luxury
having only made his excellency&rsquo;s mouth water, and there being no
other accommodation at hand, in order to relieve his salivary glands,
he was obliged to aim at an open window close by!</p>
<p>His excellency, consequently, became a sort of a proverb among them,
and the question was repeatedly asked, &ldquo;Does your American friend
still continue to enact the camel, or does he not weary of chewing the
cud?&rdquo; Unlearned in classic lore, how should they know that the
poet once said&mdash;</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Tu tantum erucis imprime dentem.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">No one is ever seated in the presence of the sultan,
nor are any of the customary rites of hospitality observed; such as the
introduction of pipes, coffee, sherbet, etc.<a id="xd25e3415" name=
"xd25e3415"></a></p>
<p>On the presentation of foreign ambassadors, the ceremony is so
arranged, that the minister plenipotentiary <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name="pb192">192</a>]</span>and
his sublime highness, enter the apartment simultaneously by opposite
doors; thus the sultan receives the representatives of foreign
potentates on foot, without condescending to rise from his seat.</p>
<p>After the audience is terminated, the royal guests are conducted
into the apartment of the Mabeyngys, where they are treated with true
Oriental hospitality and munificence.</p>
<p>Those persons who are not aware of the wonderful changes that have
taken place in Turkey, may fancy this monarch to be surrounded by a
group of robed, turbaned, and bearded Osmanlis; on the contrary, both
the sultan and his attendants now wear a European military frock coat
and pantaloons, with only the national <i>fess</i> for a
head-dress.</p>
<p>The moustache is universally worn, and it would seem as ridiculous
to an Osmanli to shave the eyebrows as the upper-lip. Indeed, nothing
excites the curiosity of the rising generation so much, as to see a man
without a moustache; especially an aged man, in whose case, it would
seem to them like an attempt at perpetual youth.</p>
<p>There is not a beard to be seen on any of the attendants of the
palace, for the beard is considered in Turkey as a mark of dignity and
freedom; consequently, no one in the personal service of the sultan
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>is allowed this honor, except by special
permission of his majesty; which implies, that the individual is no
longer retained in the palace, but soon to be elevated to some superior
office. The beard, then, being indicative of rank and position, it is
preserved with a certain superstitious reverence; no Mussulman,
therefore, after the ceremony of allowing the beard to grow has been
once performed, ever again uses the razor; nevertheless it is not
permitted to assume the natural growth, but is carefully trimmed
according to the fashion of modern times.</p>
<p>Abd-ul-Medjid makes his appearance in the Mabeyn, early in the
morning; for it is a universal custom with the Osmanlis to rise early.
He generally spends his mornings in the perusal of local and foreign
newspapers, which are translated for him, and other general
reading.</p>
<p>He has lately acquired a taste for the French language, in which he
has made considerable progress. He is, according to the Turkish
acceptance of the term, well-educated; that is, well versed in Turkish
<i lang="fr">belles-lettres</i>, with a general acquaintance with the
history of his own country.</p>
<p>The science of mathematics has also engrossed some of his attention,
and he even condescended to receive instructions from Etem Pasha, a
young man of distinguished abilities and foreign education, who
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>was taken into the royal retinue as colonel of
the body-guards; doubtless, however, with reference to his scientific
acquirements.</p>
<p>His majesty&rsquo;s meals, according to the custom of the country,
are two; one in the morning between ten and eleven, the other at
sunset. They are served by the Tcheshnigear, whose duty it is to break
the seals of the different dishes intended for the sultan&rsquo;s
repast, and after having tasted, to carry them into the royal
presence.</p>
<p>Although the Osmanlis are great epicures, their tastes are very
singular. Their dishes are very diversified and numerous, consisting
usually of twelve or fifteen, and sometimes even thirty courses; sweet
and meat dishes being introduced in alternate succession; the meal
commencing with soup, and ending with pilaf, or a preparation of rice
peculiar to Turkey. They have a species of pastry or <i>paklava</i>,
which is remarkably light and delicious; and the mohalleby, or Turkish
blanc-mange, is much liked, even by Europeans. Fruit, at
Constantinople, is very abundant and delicious, and is partaken of
frequently during a repast. Indeed, the grapes of Scutari, called
Tchavoush, are unrivalled, and even more delicious and delicate than
those of Madeira or Malaga.</p>
<p>The order in which a dinner is served is as follows: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb195" href="#pb195" name=
"pb195">195</a>]</span>soup, kebab (or roast meat in small pieces),
entremet (or vegetables and meat cooked together), pastry, roast, fish,
entremet, mohalleby, entremet, maccaroni, fowls, jelly, etc., until at
last it winds up with the significative pilaf and sherbet, or
hosh-ab.</p>
<p>No wine or liquor is served at the table, but his sublimity
occasionally during the day visits the pantry, doubtless, &ldquo;for
his stomach&rsquo;s sake, and his often infirmities.&rdquo;
Unfortunately, modern civilization has some vices as well as many
virtues; and the fashion <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href=
"#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>of excessive drinking, has, among
others, lately crept into Turkey, to which some of the <i lang=
"fr">&eacute;l&eacute;gants</i> are becoming much addicted, and, ere
long, they may, perhaps excel even the paragon, John Bull.</p>
<p>Although many other innovations and attempts at reform have
succeeded in Turkey, yet the original style of eating has not been much
improved. They use neither chairs nor tables; but a low stool being put
in the middle of the room, a large circular copper tray is placed upon
it.</p>
<p>No such paraphernalia as cloths, napkins, knives, forks, plates,
glasses, etc., are essential; small loaves of bread, alternately with
small dishes of fruit, pickles, anchovies, cheese, etc., are
indiscriminately scattered around the edges of the tray, in the middle
of which the different preparations of food are successively placed by
the ayvaz or scullion, and the food is eaten <i>with the fingers</i>,
excepting the liquid dishes, for which wooden spoons are provided.
Around the tray, the company assemble, sitting with their legs under
them, and all eating from the dish in the middle; reminding us of the
customs of ancient times, when it was said, &ldquo;It is one of the
twelve who dippeth with me in the dish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One long, narrow napkin is provided, which goes all round the tray,
and lies upon the floor; each person slipping under it as he sits down.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p>Their tables being accessible to their friends at all times,
dinner-parties are never given, except on state occasions; for,
hospitality being one of the characteristics of the East, and
especially enjoined by the Koran, no one is excluded from their board;
and when the number present is so large as not to allow them to sit
comfortably, they place themselves <i>side-wise</i>, or in a sort of
spoon fashion, as though they were leaning upon one another, and thus
illustrating the scene at the feast of the Passover.</p>
<p>In some of the houses of the wealthy, and especially of those whose
owners have visited Europe, the European mode of eating is imitated,
when the motley company, which is always assembled, sometimes presents
a most ludicrous scene.</p>
<p>Once, a Turk at such a table, wishing to conform to the customs of
civilized life, endeavored to use the fork. Failing in several attempts
to take a piece of meat, and determined to overcome his gaucherie, he
resolutely took hold of the morsel with his fingers, and placing one
end of the fork against his breast, stuck the meat upon it with an
immense effort, and then carried it to his mouth, quite contented with
his own success, amid the applause of the company. During the sacred
month of Ramazan, however, the European mode of eating is never
practised, even by the most enlightened and liberal. Knives, forks,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>tables and chairs, are then altogether set
aside, as being too profane.</p>
<p>His majesty usually breakfasts at the Mabeyn, and always quite
alone; for no one being equal to him, none can have the honor of his
company; and his evening repast is often taken, weather permitting, at
some beautiful watering-place.</p>
<p>The time between these two meals is usually occupied with some of
his ministers, or the audiences of the foreign ambassadors, and in
excursions on the Bosphorus or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Whatever transpires at the Porte, is reported to him every evening,
through the Ameddjy, or state chancellor, expressed in the most
beautiful and elegant style of which the Turkish language is capable.
In fact, the bureau of the Ameddjy is considered the best school for
polite literature, and those who have once served in that department,
invariably acquire a remarkable elegance of diction. The sultan reads
over these documents every evening, together with the Arzou-hals, or
petitions, which are presented to him on Fridays; and after giving his
imperial sanction or veto, returns them to the Porte, to be acted upon
accordingly.</p>
<p>The approval of the sultan is not expressed by the application of
any royal seal or cypher, but by a bold stroke of his majesty&rsquo;s
reed, representing the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href=
"#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>Arabic letter S, which is termed
<i>sah</i>, meaning correct or approved. And those which are rejected
are torn in one corner.</p>
<p>The sultan&rsquo;s cipher, called <i>Toora</i>, is formed from the
names of the reigning monarch, and that of his father. It reads thus,
&ldquo;Sultan Abd-ul-Medjid, son of Sultan Malmoud Khan, the sultan of
sultans.&rdquo; This is the imperial seal, and Ottoman coat of arms,
and it is affixed to all royal edicts, engraved upon public buildings,
and stamped upon the various current coins of the empire.</p>
<p>When his evening occupations are over, the sultan retires to the
harem.</p>
<p>Such is the ordinary routine of the life of the Turkish sovereign;
but there are also many other public duties which occupy his time and
attention, and fully demonstrate that the post of sultan is by no means
a sinecure. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h2 class="main">PUBLIC DUTIES OF THE SULTAN.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The sultan is obliged to attend one of the public
mosques in person every Friday, which is the Mohammedan Sunday. One
reason of his public appearance is to set an example of religious
devotion; another, to assure the people by his actual presence, that he
is in the enjoyment of life and health; and a third, to give an
opportunity to any of his discontented subjects to appeal to him in
person; for, the right of appeal has never been denied in Turkey. This
is done by a paper, which is held in the extended hand of the
petitioner, and presented anywhere in the course of the royal
route.</p>
<p>It is received by his pages and reserved for the future perusal of
his majesty. His departure, both from the palace and the mosque, is
announced by a royal salute of 21 guns from the batteries, and the
ships of war.</p>
<p>These opportunities are eagerly embraced by all strangers who wish
to gaze on the great &ldquo;<i>Tamer of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>Infidels and the
scourger of the unbelieving race of Christian vassals</i>.&rdquo; There
are two other great state festivals, on which occasions the sultan and
the whole of the royal retinue combine to present one of the most
beautiful Oriental pageants.</p>
<p>These are the feasts of Bairam, one of which occurs at the end of
Ramazan or the long fast, and the other the Courban Bairam, or feast of
the sacrifice, sixty-eight days after.</p>
<p>There is a grand state procession. Surrounded by his numerous pages
in uniforms glittering with golden embroidery and plumed head-dresses,
attended by dignitaries of the realm in full court dress, all mounted
on Arabian steeds, splendidly caparisoned, the sultan enters the mosque
of Sultan Ahmed at the ancient Hippodrome. He alights upon a velvet
carpeting, which extends into the mosque, and is supported on each side
by chamberlains.</p>
<p>As he dismounts, the voice of the assembled multitude proclaims
&ldquo;<span lang="tr">Allah Padishahumuza Oozoon e&ouml;m&uuml;rler
versin</span>,&rdquo; Long live the king&mdash;God bless the
sultan.</p>
<p>The Padishah after the performance of prayers, returns to his palace
at the Seraglio Point, where the throne room is always preserved. There
he receives the compliments of the season from his ministers and
officers of state. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202"
name="pb202">202</a>]</span></p>
<p>The procession to the mosque being public, has been described by
many who have witnessed it; but from the reception at the palace all
foreigners are excluded.</p>
<p>The sultan is seated on a chair of state, with the princes and
younger princesses of the royal blood on each side.</p>
<p>Behind the throne, in a semicircle, stand the personnel of the royal
household.</p>
<p>Opposite the throne, at the farthest end of the hall, a band of
musicians is stationed, and as they perform the national airs, the
dignitaries enter the royal presence according to their respective
ranks, to pay homage to their sovereign.</p>
<p>As has already been described, the usual mode of salutation in the
east is the temennah, made by touching the hand to the lips and then to
the forehead, which signifies affection and humility. With the desire,
however, to be more respectful, they often bend down to the ground, as
if willing to take up the very dust upon which the honored feet have
rested, or attempt to kiss the hem of the garment. But all these
ordinary modes of salutation are insufficient at a royal reception;
when a beautifully embroidered rug is spread before the sultan, on one
end of which his feet rest.</p>
<p>As they present themselves, they slowly bend <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span>their persons and touch their lips and foreheads
to the border of the carpet, which ceremony is called the kissing of
the sultan&rsquo;s feet; for, no one is allowed any actual proximity to
the royal person&mdash;thus guarding him from the assassin&rsquo;s
dagger.</p>
<p>After kissing the end of the carpet they arrange themselves in two
opposite lines on each side of the sultan, to witness the homages of
the various pashas and other dignitaries. Those who take their stand in
the presence are only the heads of the departments, both civil and
religious.</p>
<p>After the ceremony is over, every one retires to hit own dwelling,
to <i>enact</i> the sultan to his subordinates.</p>
<p>The Courban Bairam is the great festival celebrated by the pilgrims
at Mecca, in commemoration of the offering up of Ishmael; and is
generally observed throughout the Mohammedan dominions,&mdash;on which
occasion every Mussulman must kill a sheep with his own hand, and
distribute the meat to the poor.</p>
<p>The sultan performs this sacrifice at his own palace before the
morning prayers. As he stands at the threshold, a ram with gilded horns
is laid at his feet, and girding himself with a silken towel, he
completes the sacrifice.</p>
<p>The solution of this act of devotion is, that they believe that the
faithful will be transported over the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb204" href="#pb204" name="pb204">204</a>]</span><i>surat</i> or
bridge of hair into paradise on the backs of these immolated
victims.</p>
<p>The old seraglio, which was the residence of so many sultans, and
the scene of the aggrandizement and downfall of so many good
Mussulmans; under whose latticed windows the Bosphorus <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e3583" title="Source: fiows">flows</span> so deeply as
to tell no tales of the hundreds of living and beautiful maidens that
have perished in the blue waves and left no sign of their sad
fate&mdash;the bloody and mysterious seraglio is now deserted, save on
such occasions as have been described&mdash;notwithstanding
travellers&rsquo; assertions to the contrary.</p>
<p>How many of the royal blood, even sultans themselves, within this
time-worn palace, have either drained the insidious and poisoned
potion, or been dispensed with by the surer cord, or assassin&rsquo;s
dagger!</p>
<p>The last victim was Sultan Mustafa, or the uncle of the present
monarch; and Mahmoud himself was miraculously preserved by the
attachment and perseverance of his <i>lala</i> or eunuch, who concealed
him in the fire-place of the bath, until the fury of the mob had
subsided&mdash;thus saving him, whom Allah had reserved for the proud
distinction of being the savior and regenerator of his country.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that the sultans of later times have recoiled from
such associations and built for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205"
href="#pb205" name="pb205">205</a>]</span>themselves other palaces on
the bright and smiling shores of the &ldquo;ocean stream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abd-ul-Medjid has just erected a magnificent residence opposite the
entrance to the Marmora, the palace of Dolma Bahch&eacute;.

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">ROMANCE OF THE EAST.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The ordinary course of events, the humdrum monotonous
tinkling of life&rsquo;s daily and ever recurring necessities, is
wearisome to the soul. There is a longing for variety; the love of the
marvelous craves wherewith to slake its thirst, the imagination seeks
its food, and the beautiful, in fancy or reality, must sometimes
minister its soothing charms. Anything to escape from the physical,
cumbersome part of our nature, into the world of romance and visionary
exultation. War and its glory, its sudden vicissitudes of victory and
defeat, its brilliant arms and thundering voices excite the most
thrilling emotions in the bosoms of care-worn mortals. Love, with its
gentle wooing, its kind sympathies, and tender ministry, comes to the
heart, sick of itself, as the very balm of Gilead. Religion calls the
crushed and bleeding spirit to an unseen world, where fancy may
luxuriate in realms of ethereal anticipations, anon to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>become the realities of Faith, as the soul is
discharged from its mortal tenement.</p>
<p>It is, under any guise, a blissful attribute, this ability to soar
out of life&rsquo;s dullness, into scenes of imaginary hope and
brightness: to escape from the real into the unreal, whether to deeds
of heroic valor, whose charm consists in the extravagance of the
excitement, or to linger in the enchantments of a tender passion, or to
listen to the tales of others&rsquo; woes or joys: all these kindle up
the enthusiasm of the soul. But is there ever any reality to what may
be termed romance?</p>
<p>If, as some would fain have us believe, the very objects which seem
so tangible to our senses, are no realities, what then of the vagaries
of the imagination? The moment you reduce the most thrilling incident
to mere matter of fact, or divest it of the garb in which fancy ever
delights to clothe its objects, the romance loses its charm. The more
remote the scene, the more unfettered by conventionalities the actors,
the more bewitching the tale of their adventures, and the more
impossible the achievements, the better prized. Even the aid of genii
and fairies wonderfully helps on this love of the marvelous. What was
Aladdin&rsquo;s lamp more than any other old piece of copper ore, until
the slave of the lamp suddenly appeared. There has ever hung over
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>the East, a veil of mystery; it may be from the
warmth of the Oriental imagination and its own extravagant creations,
or from the seclusiveness of the women, who, as they became unfamiliar
objects, seemed to be the very Venuses and Peris of the world of fable.
The reserve of the men themselves, leaving their better halves to an
obliviousness from all the world, is calculated to excite the curiosity
of the community at home, and the rest of the world abroad, and to
invest the fair sex with most improbable charms. The difficulty and
imminent danger of a single interview, excites the love of adventure.
Tottering old crones, themselves the genuine antidotes to all passion,
point with their bony fingers to the penetralia, where a goddess in
human form enshrines her charms. Even a transformation takes place, a
new complexion is produced, feminine draperies and a basket of wares,
and you pass the unsuspecting and smooth-faced guardian of the portal.
You love to linger in the sweetly perfumed halls, to toy with the
beautiful Circassian, as she listlessly lounges on her silken couch;
you love even the sense of danger, as you start at every step, and
again relax into forgetfulness of the external world. But sometimes
there is a sequel; you <span class="corr" id="xd25e3617" title=
"Source: fiy">fly</span> for life; your lovely companion bares her neck
to the bow-string, her beautiful form enters the mystic veil of the
lost <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href="#pb209" name=
"pb209">209</a>]</span>woman; the coarse and heavy sack, her
coffin&mdash;her grave the blue and briny wave of the ocean stream.</p>
<p>All this is wild, romantic, thrilling, and tragic. But how rare the
occurrence; and of the multitude of adventure-loving, romance-seeking
beings that people earth&rsquo;s surface, to whose lot shall we assign
the realization? All dream; but how few wake to the vision in
life&rsquo;s action. All fancy; but when does not the broad sunshine of
earth&rsquo;s glare dispel the wreathed and mistlike draperies of
imagination. The ideal has an existence only in the &ldquo;mind&rsquo;s
eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is, then, no more romance in the East than elsewhere; indeed
there is even more of natural life divested of all extravagance of
fiction. The very lack of education, which, in some respects, is
certainly to be lamented, tends to fasten their hearts together, in the
bonds of nature&rsquo;s best affections. Home has joys enough for their
simple souls; so entirely devoid of that refined selfishness, which in
other lands seems to annihilate those sweet provisions for kindred
sympathies, which arise from the reciprocal affinities of parent and
child, brother and sister. There is little food then for morbid
imaginations, but much for natural pleasures and simple tastes. The
very externals of Orientalism are making their exit from the
world&rsquo;s scene; soon there will not exist even the illusion of
characteristic and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210"
name="pb210">210</a>]</span>graceful forms. Ere long we shall realize,
that, divested of form and coloring, of tinsel and decoration, the
descendants of the great common ancestor of the human race, are all
alike in feature, nature, and spirit.</p>
<p>Indeed a general acquaintance with the different tribes and nations
under heaven only serves to convince the cosmogonist, that all are of
one family, have a common nature or origin, are but human, and liable
to human frailties and passions. The most powerful emotions are felt in
the bosoms of the savage and the polite. Ambition, love, hatred,
revenge, and a like train of absorbing impulses, rule and sway wherever
man has planted his footsteps. But how interesting to mark the
influence of circumstances, to define the latitudes and longitudes of
ideas and actions, to measure the rise and fall of the thermometer of
life, according to the various climes on earth&rsquo;s broad surface,
to feel the pulse of the dissenting creeds and dogmas, in a word, to
observe the same faculties under such varied culture.</p>
<p>In comparing the different grades of education and civilization, it
is curious to observe how often an innate refinement of feeling equals,
if not supersedes, the greatest efforts of cultivation, or the
brightest results of philosophy. A lifetime spent in the schools often
leaves the man far behind one, whose early <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211" name=
"pb211">211</a>]</span>years have passed in shrewd observation, and
practical experience, for while the one is reasoning, abstracting,
ruminating, the other experiments, and lo! he enters the very
penetralia of the temple of wisdom. And where do we find the most
susceptible hearts, the most poetical fancies, the purest aspirations
of nature? Not among the dry and tutored reasoners of civilization, but
where the mind of man has been untrammeled by rules and etiquettes,
forms and ceremonies. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href=

<h2 class="main">THE HAREM.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p>We cannot deny that habit is second nature&mdash;the axiom holds
good in every form of social existence; yet there is a universal
disposition to mutual criticism and condemnation, whether between
nations or neighbors. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href=
"#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>There is always the vibrating why
and wherefore, and each, approves his own course of action, without
ceding to others the same privilege.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the peculiar style of the toilet of the
Turkish ladies would be deprecated by the belles of modern Christendom.
Indeed, we have often heard these fastidious dames exclaim, in
regarding representations of their Eastern rivals, &ldquo;most horribly
indecent,&rdquo; while they turned their sensitive vision from the
offenders against all delicacy. And, on the other hand, we have heard
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name=
"pb214">214</a>]</span>Osmanli Hanums and Efendis express equal honor
at the sight of a European lady, <i>en costume de bal</i>.</p>
<p>When the Marchioness of Londonderry presented herself at the palace
of the sultan, <i>en grand tenue</i> for a reception, the gentlemen in
waiting could scarcely persuade themselves to conduct her ladyship into
the royal presence, so astonished were they at the display of the fair
neck, shoulders, etc.</p>
<p>Both the Western and Eastern toilets may be styled <i lang=
"fr">d&eacute;collet&eacute;es</i>, the one a horizontal, the other a
longitudinal display of charms. But one thing may be said in favor of
the Orientals, that they never appear in public without covering their
necks and bosoms, and even veiling their features; they are only
permitted to appear uncovered at home, and even then only in the
presence of their nearest relatives. On the contrary, on the most
public occasions, at the operas, balls, soir&eacute;es, and many other
grand assemblies, do the Western d&eacute;collet&eacute;es delight to
vie with each other in their various styles of full dress; they are
even so fastidious as to have no nomenclature but ankles, while they
willingly pay their dollars to see a full extension of these same
ankles on the stage.</p>
<p>The Turkish ladies with perfect indifference present their
unslippered and even unhosed feet to any shop-boy, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name="pb215">215</a>]</span>at
the same time carefully concealing their <i>shalvar</i>, or full
trowsers, which are fastened below the knee, and tucked up whenever
they sally forth for a <i lang="fr">promenade &agrave; pied ou en
voiture</i>.</p>
<p>As to the intrinsic merit or real modesty of these different styles,
peculiar tastes and prevailing modes can only decide; for habit is
strong in its sway, and imitation is a kindred principle. Therefore,
there is neither vice nor virtue in walking in the footsteps of our
predecessors, or each man or woman adopting the peculiar modes and
customs of their own people. As fertile a brain may throb beneath a
turban as a hat, as pure a form enshroud itself in a modest veil as
lurks beneath the shadow of a Parisian bonnet. What are externals but
whims and caprices; it is the virtue of domestic institutions and daily
habitudes that stamps the character of a people.</p>
<p>European or American ladies may grace their boudoirs, models of
beauty and excellence, and Turkish Hanums may, by the exercise of
domestic virtues, equally adorn and ennoble the precincts of their
Harems.</p>
<p>The word Harem is familiar to most persons, but how grossly
misunderstood. Some have considered it as unmentionable to ears polite;
while the votaries of pleasure, ever ready to indulge their longing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>fancies, have pictured it to themselves as the
earthly realization of the Paradise of Mohammed. Indeed many European
authors in describing the licentious and corrupted courts of their own
monarchs, have seemed to consider this term as the most distinguishing
compendium of immorality.</p>
<p>Strange perversion, that the very word which inspires every
Oriental, whether Mohammedan or Christian, with the greatest respect,
should suggest to the mind of a European only a system of concubinage
and licentiousness.</p>
<p>What then is <i>Harem</i>?</p>
<p>One peculiarity in the construction of society in its primitive
condition was that <i>might makes right</i>. This not only affected
personal property, but even the more domestic relations. If an enemy
strong enough felt the inclination, he might rob his neighbor of his
wife or family, of which there are instances on Biblical record.</p>
<p>To avoid any occasions of such unjust appropriation, it became a
policy to seclude the women from general observation.</p>
<p>The unbounded hospitality of those good old days when the worthy
patriarchs lived with open doors, and good cheer; when the three
virtues which made a man distinguished, were bravery, eloquence, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>hospitality, or in the hyperbole of the times, a
sharp sword, a sweet tongue, and forty tables; in such an era of
benevolence it became necessary to separate the more precious and
defenseless portion of the family from the vulgar gaze.</p>
<p>The seclusion of women, then, has ever been one of the greatest
social <span class="corr" id="xd25e3711" title=
"Source: peculiarites">peculiarities</span> of the East, and does not
date its origin from modern times, nor even from the foundation of the
Moslem faith. In some forms, it existed in the times of the ancient
Jews; for, when Rebecca lifted up her eyes and saw Isaac, who had gone
out to meditate in the field at even tide, she said unto the servant,
&ldquo;What man is this, who walketh in the field to meet
us?<span class="corr" id="xd25e3714" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span> and the servant said, <span class="corr"
id="xd25e3717" title="Not in source">&ldquo;</span>It is my master,
<i>therefore she took a veil and covered herself</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried
through the <i>lattice</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same institution existed among the Arabs from time immemorial,
so that Mohammed was not the originator of this separation of women
from general society, but rather the sustainer of an old and
established usage, which the condition of the community in his times,
rendered imperative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak unto the true believers, that they restrain their eyes,
and keep themselves from immodest actions. This will be more pure for
them, for God <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>is well acquainted with that which they do; and
speak unto the believing women, that they restrain their eyes, and
preserve their modesty, and discover not their ornaments (personal
charms), except what necessarily appeareth thereof; and let them throw
their veils over their bosoms, and not show their ornaments, unless to
their husbands or their fathers, or their husband&rsquo;s fathers, or
their sons, or their husband&rsquo;s sons, or their brother&rsquo;s
sons, or unto such as attend them and have no need of women, or unto
children who distinguish not the nakedness of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Supposing then society were on a different basis, according to these
tenets, the women would be perpetually veiled, and the men ever
wandering with averted eyes. In order to remedy these evils, and
facilitate their seclusion, the houses are all divided into two sets of
apartments, the Selamluk, or men&rsquo;s apartment, and the Harem, or
the sanctuary of the women, where no men are allowed to enter, except
those specified by the Prophet.</p>
<p>Now, it is evident that the principle upon which society is
constructed in the East, is the careful seclusion of women from the
gaze of the world.</p>
<p>The peculiar charm of modesty is known and acknowledged all over the
world, as the domestic arrangements of civilized society everywhere
demonstrate. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Greeks of Homer&rsquo;s day had their <span class="trans" title=
"gynaikeion"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&gamma;&upsilon;&nu;&alpha;&iota;&kappa;&epsilon;&#8150;&omicron;&nu;</span></span>,
the Romans, in imitation, their Gyn&aelig;ceum; and modern civilization
has created its <i>boudoir</i>; but none of these terms are as
expressive of the sanctity of the abode, as the word Harem of the
Orientals.</p>
<p>It is well known that the cities of Mecca and Medina are the holy
shrines of the Mohammedan faith. No other appellative is used in
speaking of them, but the same word Harem, which, when used in the
plural, in itself comprises these venerated cities. They say,
Hadjj-ul-Haremein, or pilgrim of the two harems, meaning the holy Mecca
and Medina. This word is applied to the temple itself at Mecca, which
is honored by the title of Mesjad-el-Harem, the sacred or inviolable
temple.</p>
<p>Thus some idea may be formed of the etymology of the term and its
sacred signification, when used by the Arabs and other Orientals, to
designate their firesides or family homes; the sanctity of which, not
only admits of no intrusion, but any summons or interruption to the
master of the family after he has once retired, is considered
indecorous.</p>
<p>Mohammed received a revelation regarding himself, while he was
engaged in his harem preparing the Koran.</p>
<p>Some persons had the rudeness to call him out. In order to reprove
them, and like sinners in all times to come, the following passage was
revealed: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>interior</i> of thy dwelling is a sanctuary; they who
violate it by calling unto thee, are deficient in the respect which
they owe to the interpreter of heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This passage has not only rendered the interior of the dwelling,
viz. the harem, an inviolable asylum to the female portion of the
family, but it has made it a convenient place of refuge to pashas and
efendis, where they often seek repose from the multitude of unwelcome
visitors who infest, with perfect freedom, and at all hours, their
selamluks.</p>
<p>The frequent visits of the Osmanlis to their harems, are not always
indications of the attractions within, but other external motives may
impel them thither; nevertheless, the inviolability of these precincts
has induced the supposition that they contained naught but the shrine
of the fair Goddess of Beauty, and her sly coadjutor.</p>
<p>The upper part of a house in America, or those rooms appropriated to
the exclusive use of the ladies, are as sacred and inviolable as any
Oriental harem; and are not, as a matter of course, supposed to be the
scenes of mystery and intrigue. Indeed, it is fully evident that the
same spirit of deference to the comfort of the fair sex, exists in
America, where is seen over one of the principal entrances to the
general post-office, the announcement, &ldquo;Exclusively <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>for
Ladies,&rdquo; which in Turkey would be intimated by the single and
expressive word <span class="sc">HAREM</span>.</p>
<p>Again the &ldquo;Ladies&rsquo; Cabin&rdquo; on board the steamers
would, in the East, be designated by the word Harem, written in golden
characters, which would at once indicate its sacred nature, and inspire
every Oriental with the respect due to the sex, which is even more
imperative in that clime than in other lands, where they make a glory
and boast of their excessive deference to the fairer portion of the
community.</p>
<p>Hence how erroneous the impression, that the harem is a species of
female prison, established by the tyranny of men, where the weaker sex
are forcibly shut up against their will.</p>
<p>If the Osmanli ladies were under no other restrictions, their own
sense of self-respect, based upon time-hallowed usage, and inculcated
by the precepts of their religion, would compel them to the same
seclusion. I one day happened to be in the dressing room of a pasha,
adjoining the harem; when he left the room for a moment. In the
interval, his daughter, supposing her father quite alone, suddenly
entered the apartment; but on seeing me there, instinctively covering
her face with the drapery of her sleeve, as suddenly disappeared. While
I myself as instinctively displayed my sense of the courtesy
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222" href="#pb222" name=
"pb222">222</a>]</span>due to a lady, by looking as far as I could in
an opposite direction.</p>
<p>I heard her remarking to the slaves in the next room, that she was
so mortified, for, instead of seeing her father there stood
&mdash;&mdash; as large as life.</p>
<p>Her feeling at being seen without the precincts of the harem
<i>unveiled</i>, was the same as would be experienced by a lady of this
country, who should be surprised by the sight of a gentleman, when she
was <i lang="fr">en toilette de nuit</i>!</p>
<p>Nor is this seclusion entirely Mohammedan, but being an ancient
custom of the East, it is practised by all who dwell in that clime. The
families of the rayas, or non-mussulman subjects of the Porte,
consisting of the Armenians, Greeks, and Jews, are also under the same
social laws as their Mohammedan compatriots. It is true, that in
proportion as European customs have found their way into these
countries, the rigidity of the Christians has relaxed in this respect;
because the observance in question has never been incorporated with
their religion; whereas Mohammed, on the contrary, took special pains
to enforce the practice upon his followers.</p>
<p>The word harem being by courtesy applied also to its inmates, has
now become a general term to designate the female portion of the
family, and is by no means synonymous with polygamy, otherwise the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>same expression would not be used by the
Christian subjects in speaking of their domestic relations.</p>
<p>It would be said that a certain pasha or an Armenian banker had gone
to a distant place without his harem, or family.</p>
<p>An Osmanli lady, on being informed of the arrival of an American
minister in Constantinople, would naturally inquire whether he was
accompanied by his harem, or family. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">CONDITION OF WOMEN.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is fortunate that the less enlightened members of
the human family are unconscious of their comparative
inferiority&mdash;and are ignorant of the bliss to which the more
sublimated specimens of humanity are constantly aspiring, and even
rendering themselves discontented with real life, as destiny has
accorded it to them.</p>
<p>The actual condition of women in the East is not then so much to be
lamented, as their ideal of happiness so essentially differs from that
of other portions of the fair sex in Europe or America. As no other
philosophy has yet crept into their minds, they dream not of
&ldquo;woman&rsquo;s rights,&rdquo; &ldquo;free love&rdquo; or
&ldquo;equality of the sexes,&rdquo; and calmly content themselves with
the rights of nature, and the relative position which has ever existed
among their simple and patriarchal ancestors. The Osmanlis have not yet
deviated from the form of family government which nature dictated to
them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span></p>
<p>The venerable father, who has guided his children through youth, and
even counseled them in maturer years, is the monarch in the family
circle&mdash;the Dei penates are no creations of myth&mdash;but are
embodied in the one and sacred title of <i lang="la">Pater
familias</i>.</p>
<p>Each son, as he succeeds to the paternal duties, is invested with
the robes of veneration and respect. Thus the male branches of the
household have a prior rank, which is unconsciously recognized by the
women and younger members of the family. The laws even allow to the son
double the share of inheritance that they do to the daughters, because
of the heavy responsibilities which may devolve upon him in future by
the death of the father.</p>
<p>There is not, therefore, the most distant suspicion in their
composition that females are equal to males, or girls to boys. It is as
if the members of the body should revolt, and the hands and feet
proclaim themselves superior, or even equal, to the head.</p>
<p>The women of Turkey know very well, and gracefully submit to facts,
which are stubborn things. They never think of denying that</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Women first were made for men,</p>
<p class="line">Not men for them.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">There are countries where the condition of woman is
indeed miserable, and where, also, they are unconscious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>of
their own degradation, and willingly toil and drudge in the service of
men; content with the slightest proofs of affection with which their
lords may honor them&mdash;indeed, any concession to their woman nature
is thankfully received.</p>
<p>To be bought and sold is a matter of course. In China, the purchased
wife is suddenly transported into the family of a man, whose name even
she has never heard. There she is the slave of the whole establishment.
The husband may beat her with impunity, reduce her to a state of
starvation, or hire her out, if he fancies to do so.</p>
<p>The Hindoo forces her to immolate herself on her husband&rsquo;s
funeral pile&mdash;after having spent a lifetime in his slavery and
service.</p>
<p>Such barbarities are unknown in Turkey. For in no country in the
world are mothers more respected, wives more tenderly cherished, and
children more idolized. If, in the relative position of the sexes, men
rank above women, it is because the man is considered as the
<i>vital</i> principle, and the woman the <i>material</i>. Hence the
man loves and cherishes the woman, who in return regards him with
reverence and respect; and any deviation from these reciprocal
affections, would be considered as the greatest breach of decorum.</p>
<p>There are certain acts of politeness which devolve <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>altogether upon the lords of creation in the
most exquisitely civilized regions of the world, which are however
sometimes reluctantly performed&mdash;but, as usual, such matters are
reversed in the East, where even the sun rises at a different hour.
There the Efendi graciously receives a glass of water at the hands of
his too happy Hanum; his pipe and his <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb228" href="#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>coffee are gracefully
served by some fair Hebe of a wife or sister, who naturally considers
herself as the helpmeet for her spouse, as did Eve, the first and
fairest of woman kind.</p>
<p>The reluctance they feel to have their ladies appear in general
society does not arise from any want of deference and respect on the
part of the men, but rather from an intuitive desire to guard and
protect them from public scandal.</p>
<p>As the Osmanlis enshrine the objects of their affection in the
recesses of their own hearts, so they love to guard them from all
contact of a selfish world. Indeed, Moore has beautifully expressed
their feelings in the warblings of the Peri,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;No pearl ever lay under Oman&rsquo;s green
water,</p>
<p class="line">More pure in its shell, than thy spirit in
thee.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">They feel so sensitive on this score, that they do not
make their Harems a subject of conversation. Even the most distant
allusion to this part of their establishment would consequently be, not
only indelicate, but also an infringement of etiquette&mdash;so that
the ordinary questions, such as &ldquo;how are madam and the
ladies,&rdquo; or according to Irish vocabulary, &ldquo;how&rsquo;s yer
wife and the gals,&rdquo; would cause the lord of the house to redden
with astonishment. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229"
name="pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>As a further proof of the respect a man is supposed to feel for his
family, his enemy, when wishing to touch him to the quick, in cursing
him, only utters maledictions against his wife, mother, or sister.</p>
<p>A man may be publicly executed, but a woman is sacked, <i>entirely
out of respect</i>.</p>
<p>A Turkish lady is eminently queen of her own dominions, sometimes
even a despot&mdash;and most independent on all occasions, both public
and private.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for ladies to be attended by their husband or
any other gentleman when they go out; public sentiment entirely
protects them; for, if any one should accost them rudely, the commonest
citizen would immediately turn avenger. When the ladies are attended by
servants and eunuchs, they are only appendages of rank and
distinction.</p>
<p>They seem, indeed, to be a privileged class. Wherever they appear
the men must retire&mdash;and woe to the man who ventures upon a
warfare of words with a Turkish woman; for her tongue has no bounds,
and her slipper is a ready weapon of chastisement; and no man would
dare to repel the attack.</p>
<p>The convenience of the slipper as a ready means of self-defence,
seems to have been familiar in the days of the old classics, for, the
Roman poet says:</p>
<div lang="la" class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Et sole&acirc; pulsare nates,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span></p>
<p>And doubtless many of the rising generation can testify to its
abuse, even in these days of modern improvement.</p>
<p>The very whims and caprices which seem indigenous to the fair sex,
are tolerated as a matter of course with philosophic resignation, as
they are instructed by the Koran, &ldquo;If ye be kind towards women
and fear to wrong them, God is well acquainted with what ye do.&rdquo;
They have a proverb also which supplants all reasoning on such
occasions.</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Satchi-ouzoun, Akli-Kissa.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="line">Long hair, short brains.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">To salute a lady, or in any way accost her, in public
would be an act of consummate rudeness; even a husband would pass by
his wife and family with an air of affected indifference. Certainly
such a neglect of the fair sex would be unpardonable in Europe and this
country, but on the contrary, in the East, it only evinces the greatest
deference and respect.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Mohammedans have been most maliciously reported by
ignorant writers on the East, to hold that women have <i>no souls</i>;
or if they have, that they will perish like those of brute beasts.</p>
<p>This assumption is founded upon the promise of the Prophet, that the
faithful shall be provided with black-eyed Houris in Paradise.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href="#pb231" name=
"pb231">231</a>]</span></p>
<p>If this excludes the Mussulman women from Paradise, we may
reasonably place the Christian ladies in the same category, for they
are assured in the Gospel that &ldquo;there will be no marrying nor
giving in marriage in Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the contrary, Houris are but an addition to the earthly wives of
the Mussulmans, and the faithful are assured that &ldquo;God promiseth
unto the true believers, <i>both men and women</i>, gardens through
which rivers flow, wherein they shall remain for ever,&rdquo; and that
&ldquo;whoso doth good works, whether he be <i>male</i> or
<i>female</i>, and is a true believer, shall be <i>admitted</i> into
Paradise, and shall not in the least be unjustly dealt with.&rdquo;

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">PERSONAL APPEARANCE AND COSTUME.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first years of the life of every girl are spent
both in the Harem and Selamluk (or men&rsquo;s apartment),
indiscriminately. The female children being then allowed free access to
the society of the men, they imbibe certain notions in their youth,
which are not always consistent with refinement.</p>
<p>As there is not in the Selamluk, the restraint which the presence of
ladies always imposes, the manners and conversation of the men are
often but ill calculated to nurture a sense of delicacy in the minds of
the children, who mingle so freely with them. Nevertheless, they seem
to possess an innate sense of propriety, and are never deficient in
politeness of deportment.</p>
<p>Every girl is permitted to attend either the public schools, or to
receive private instruction at home, until she is eight or ten years of
age, when she is no longer allowed the freedom of her childhood. Very
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>little learning is acquired by them, the
language being difficult, and the mode of instruction altogether
unsystematical; so that for all future years they retain their
simplicity, and are but overgrown children.</p>
<p>Their minds having had no culture, the senses assume entire dominion
over them, and their time is spent either in adorning their persons, or
in etiquetical observances, by which they hope to render themselves
more bewitching to the lords of creation.</p>
<p>As in all other countries, fashion is regulated by the court, so at
Constantinople it is controlled by the ladies of the palace. Their
costume, according to the Oriental taste, always consisting of long
flowing robes, may be supposed to admit of no change; but on the
contrary, the ladies having little other occupation, delight in varying
the shape and style of their dress. Sometimes the hair is worn long,
again cropped short. A fess with flossy tassel is one day the mode, and
a fantastic turban is adopted the next morning. The sleeves are long
and wide, and again their drapery is dispensed with, and they are
confined at the wrist.</p>
<p>The <i>entary</i>, or dress, is invariably cut high, either closed
around the neck, or left open in front; it is made long, trailing about
a yard below the person; sometimes left open at the sides to the hips,
and at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name=
"pb234">234</a>]</span>others, made wide, and sewed up as low as the
ankles.</p>
<p>The <i>shalvar</i>, or full trowsers, are made to match the dress,
and again of varied and contrasting hues.</p>
<p>There in a great variety in the fashion for trimming the dresses and
handkerchiefs, which generally are adorned with most exquisite
embroideries in silk or gold, as may suit the mode, or taste of the
wearer. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>Sometimes an immense cashmere shawl is wound
round the waist; at others, a light gauze scarf, or belt of gold, with
a clasp adorned with brilliants, serves for a girdle. No Turkish lady
can dispense with jewelry, and even women of the lowest rank adorn
themselves with diamonds.</p>
<p>Abundant occupation is afforded to the jewellers by the constant
transformation of their <i>bijouterie</i>; for one day the capricious
beauties fancy a star or a crescent, and the next, nothing will suit
their toilet but a large spray of brilliants.</p>
<p>The number of the ladies in the royal palace and in other wealthy
harems, all of whom are bedecked in elegant and costly costumes, causes
a demand for the services of many merchants, through whom the last new
fashion is immediately promulgated.</p>
<p>Their beauty is such, however, that it might well afford to be
unadorned, for their complexions are generally exceedingly fair, and of
the most delicate softness; owing to the constant use of the bath, as
well as the protection of the <i>yashmack</i>, or veil, without which
they never go abroad.</p>
<p>Their features are very regular, and their almond shaped eyes, so
much sung by their poets, are dark and lustrous, and so valued for
their size, that the enjoyment of the great-eyed ladies is promised by
Mohammed as one of the sublimest joys of Paradise. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name="pb236">236</a>]</span>The
power of these electric and darkly beautiful orbs is so terrible, that
woe to those upon whom they are turned, for, as Pertev Pasha, one of
their celebrated poets, has described:</p>
<p class="first">&ldquo;On the point of each ray that is darted from
those bright meteors, there is a bloody slaughter house,&rdquo; or as
the French would expressively say, &ldquo;<span lang="fr">un regard
assassin.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Exquisitely arched eyebrows are also so essential to their ideas of
beauty, that they are never contented, till by the repeated application
of artificial means, they raise their brows to a lofty semicircle.</p>
<p>Beauty spots, or moles, are considered of great value; and if nature
has proved niggard in this respect, art is brought into requisition to
produce the same contrasting effect between the tiny circle of jetty
hue and the surrounding fairness. The poet Hafiz has sung their value
in flowing numbers, offering the wealth of Semerkand and Bokhara for
the possession of the Indian mole on the cheek of the fair beauty of
Shiraz.</p>
<p>The tips of their fingers and toes are frequently stained with
<i>henna</i>, producing the roseate hue so much &agrave; la mode.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=
"pb237">237</a>]</span></p>
<p>Their forms and movements are graceful, being under no artificial
restraints; and there is an exquisite charm about them as they
languidly lounge on their silken couches, or glide about from room to
room in long flowing robes, and slip-shod <i>shup-shups</i>.</p>
<p>Well has the illustrious bard portrayed the varied charms of the
Eastern houris:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Many and beautiful lay those around,</p>
<p class="line xd25e4020">Like flowers of different hue and clime, and
root,</p>
<p class="line">In some exotic garden sometimes found,</p>
<p class="line xd25e4020">With cost, and care, and warmth, induced to
shoot.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Considering their limited education, it is delightful
to listen to the melodious tone of their voices, as they speak with
remarkable purity the harmonious Turkish language. Notwithstanding
their lack of learning, there have been some among the ladies renowned
for their poetical productions, such as Leyla and Fitnett Hanums,
justly celebrated for their exquisite poetry. <span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">DOMESTIC ARRANGEMENTS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The interior arrangements of the Turkish apartments
and their furniture, are very peculiar, and quite unlike those of
European or American drawing rooms, being entirely adapted to the
habits and tastes of the Orientals. There is never any doubt or
hesitation as to the place suitable to be occupied by any one who may
happen to enter a room; nor is it possible to mistake the different
ranks of its occupants.</p>
<p>Generally there is a sofa on three sides of the room, sufficiently
ample to accommodate the ladies in their style of sitting, which is not
cross-legged as is usually represented in pictures, but with the limbs
folded under their persons and carefully concealed by the drapery of
their long robes; for to show these parts of the person while sitting,
is considered a great breach of etiquette. Hence no Osmanli lady is
ever to be seen perched on the very edge of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>sofa, but leaving her slippers on the floor, she
steps upon the couch and gracefully bending her knees, sits reclining
against the cushions behind her.</p>
<p>On the floor, at the foot of the sofa, are placed mattresses,
furnished with cushions, and these are called <i lang="tr">erkean
mindery</i> or seats of homage, where humbler visitors or members of
the family are allowed to place themselves. The angles or corners of
the sofa, are regarded as the seats of honor, and the places on either
side, rank in regular succession down to the seat of homage; but the
most honorable person in the company may, at her or his option, occupy
any part of the couch, when the rest place themselves on each side
according to their own rank. The servants are always present, and stand
in a row at the lower end of the room, their arms humbly folded on
their girdles, attentive to the slightest nod of their superiors.</p>
<p>There are several windows on each of the three sides of the room, so
as to permit a full view of the surrounding scenery, while they are
seated; for the Osmanlis are very fond of sunlight and the beauties of
nature. The windows of the harem are all furnished with close lattices,
permitting those within to see without being seen.</p>
<p>The more modernized <i>salons</i>, have only a sofa on one side,
European couches, chairs, tables, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb240" href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>mirrors, being
substituted for the other sofas. They also endeavor to imitate the
Europeans in the style of the window draperies, which are often of the
most brilliant hues.</p>
<p>There is one peculiarity in the Oriental houses. You may wander from
one end to the other and not see a single bed-room or any of its
appurtenances&mdash;which has induced many persons to report them as
sleeping on the sofas, and never dressing or undressing. It would,
however, seem more natural to suppose, that the Osmanlis never had any
but day dreams.</p>
<p>The fact is, that the beds are all packed away in large closets
during the day-time, and spread upon the floor at night. In the houses
of the wealthy, the mattresses and coverlets are made of the richest
materials, and the sheets of beautiful silk gauze, manufactured in
Broossa. The whole appearance of the bed, so brilliant in hue, and rich
in ornament, is very different from the style of a European couch.</p>
<p>Every house has an infinite number and variety of extra beds and
bedding, to be spread on the floors of any of the apartments, for the
accommodation of visitors&mdash;hospitality being one of the most
religious precepts and observances of the Orientals.</p>
<p>In the sultan&rsquo;s palace, however, and in the families
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>of the wealthy, especially of those pashas who
have resided in Europe, bedsteads have been introduced.</p>
<p>Upon rising, the person claps her hands, as the apartments are never
furnished with bell ropes, and immediately the attendants
appear&mdash;one holding the basin, another the ewer, and a third
presenting the towel, richly embroidered at the ends.</p>
<p>The usual method of warming the houses, is by the <i>mangal</i> and
<i>tandur</i>. The mangal is generally made of brass highly polished,
somewhat in the form of an hour-glass, about a foot and a half high,
and two, or two and a half in diameter; and contains a large pan of
ignited charcoal.</p>
<p>The tandur consists of a wooden frame about the height and size of a
table, lined with tin, under which a pan of fire is placed, and the
whole is covered with a thickly wadded quilt. This is surrounded by
sofas, and they sit with their legs and feet under the covering.</p>
<p>More cozy than any capacious arm-chair, or softly yielding fauteuil,
is this same tandur. The genial warmth excites a wonderful sympathy in
its occupants. They warm to each other, and to the world in general,
and never neglect to take cognizance of their neighbor&rsquo;s affairs
and doings. From the palace of the sultan to the cottage of the crone,
they benignantly travel, bestowing on each and all a blessing, or
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>when necessary, even a cursing. The ups and
downs of pashas, probable and accomplished&mdash;whispers of the
sultan&rsquo;s favorites, or of the efendi&rsquo;s coquettish
ladies&mdash;the style of Adil&eacute; Sultan&rsquo;s feradj&eacute;,
or the grand vezir&rsquo;s fess, are each and all passed in review,
until you wonder how ever a set of miserable imprisoned women should be
such arrant gossips. Ah! one cannot believe the fair sex so unjust to
themselves, even in Turkey, as to neglect the observation of those
interesting little items of public or retired life, which become great
and weighty affairs, when discussed by ruby lips, and in the cadence of
sweet-toned voices.</p>
<p>They possess a most lady-like love of chit-chat, and so little do
they covet repose for their delicate jaws, that should conversation
lag, they keep them in motion by the use of mastic, which is always in
readiness, preserved in little jewelled boxes.</p>
<p>It is only of late years, that those hot, repelling machines called
<i>stoves</i>, have been introduced; but they have by no means
superseded the social and old-fashioned tandur, whose warmth, and
luxurious cushions, often beguile its occupants to slumber, during
which the fire is overturned, and thus occur many of the conflagrations
so frequent in Turkey.</p>
<p>There are two occasions when the still air resounds with the echoes
of human voices. The chant of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243"
href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>Muezzin from the
minar&eacute;, slowly and musically vibrating through the atmosphere,
enticing all to linger at the casement or in the thoroughfare to catch
its melodious accents; and the terrible cry of <i lang="tr">yangun
var!</i> Fire! Fire! accompanied by the reverberations of the
watchman&rsquo;s club striking upon the pavement.</p>
<p>A thrill of horror pervades every heart, for there are no bounds to
the devouring element.</p>
<p>There are two towers, one at the Serask&eacute;r&rsquo;s in the city
itself, and the other on the Galata hill, which command an extensive
isometrical view of the whole metropolis and its suburbs.</p>
<p>Here guards are stationed, who descry the first indications of fire,
and immediately give, from the top of the towers, the requisite signal,
by hoisting, in the day-time, an immense globe, painted red, and at
night by producing a bright and steady light&mdash;these signals remain
until the fire is extinguished.</p>
<p>At Candilly, on the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus, and half way up
the stream, there are a battery and a flag-staff stationed on the
mountain top called <i lang="tr">Kenan-tepessy</i>; as soon as the
signals are seen, the fire globe ascends the flag-staff, and the
battery discharges a certain number of guns, according to the locality
of the conflagration.</p>
<p>From the towers, detailed officers, <i lang=
"tr">Ne&ouml;betgees</i>, are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244"
href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>dispatched to the different
ministers, and guard houses, where the engines are kept, who create a
tremendous sensation, as they rush wildly about, brandishing their
batons of office, and with a protracted yell, warning every one to
clear the way. The different <i lang="tr">Bekgees</i> or district
watchmen, now take up the cry&mdash;striking their iron-shod clubs on
the pavement and repeating with all the power of their lungs <i lang=
"tr">yangun-var! Stambolda!</i> or there is fire at Stamboul.</p>
<p>The firemen assemble at their respective quarters, and shouldering
their engines, rush to the scene. These firemen receive no pay, but are
exempt from taxes and allowed certain other privileges&mdash;yet they
always manage to extort certain compensations for their services, from
the victims of the devastating element. The engines are small and
portable, on account of the narrowness and steepness of the streets,
nor is there any connexion-hose attached to them, the water being
supplied with buckets; yet it is astonishing how much they effect even
with such inadequate means.</p>
<p>The inflammable materials of which the houses are constructed, the
narrow streets, winding up the hillside like foot-paths, the irregular
and projecting dwellings, from which the people could shake hands with
their opposite neighbors, if it were only the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>fashion in Turkey, contribute to make a most
desirable promenade for the Fire-King when he sallies forth.</p>
<p>The flames leap from house to house; the burning cinders fly in all
directions, and the fire kindles at many and distant points; so that in
less than half an hour, a large district is often wrapt in flames.</p>
<p>The general panic is so intense, that the whole community is roused;
the pashas desert their couches, and even the sultan himself sometimes
repairs to the scene, to animate, by his presence, the efforts of the
desperate firemen. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246"

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">SOCIAL INTERCOURSE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It seems something of an anomaly that a race of beings
so distinguished for selfishness, should be so exceedingly social in
their inclinations.</p>
<p>Birds of a feather flock together, and man loves his fellow, though
he loves himself better.</p>
<p>To prevent the inroad of this extreme selfishness, certain forms and
ceremonies are established in every community where there is any
interchange of mutual civilities.</p>
<p>Oriental life has many distinguishing peculiarities and
characteristic forms of politeness, but unlike other parts of the
globe, etiquette in the East is permanent and general. The mental
accomplishments being but few, wealth seems to constitute the only
aristocratic distinction, while the poorest and the richest are equally
well versed in the established routine of civility.</p>
<p>It is curious to observe the native refinement even <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>of
the lower classes in Turkey. There is no <i>gaucherie</i>, no
reluctance in any one to do the right thing in the right way and place;
no fear of being unlike other distinguished personages in manners and
customs; for there is no doubt as to the prescribed and most elegant
style of conduct; even the salutations, compliments and congratulations
are most carefully worded, and any deviation from the formula would
destroy the intended effect.</p>
<p>There is, consequently, no lack of social etiquette among the
Osmanlis. A visitor is received according to her station in life, and
after being announced, is met by the lady of the house with her suite,
at the head of the staircase, or at the door of the saloon, or
sometimes by merely stepping down from the sofa, as may be demanded by
the rank of the guest.</p>
<p>There is no ceremony of introducing one person to another, nor is
there any shaking of hands. The company salute each other without any
regard to previous acquaintance; and the younger members of society
always kiss the hem of the garment, or the hands of their superiors in
rank and age.</p>
<p>The manner of salutation varies&mdash;those of equal rank endeavor
to kiss the hem of each other&rsquo;s garments, or only exchange
<i>temennas</i>.</p>
<p>The temenna, which has already been described, is a graceful
salutation, and is used as frequently as <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span><i>thank you</i> by
the English; serving as an acknowledgment for all compliments and kind
inquiries.</p>
<p>When one thinks of the innumerable occasions on which this
expressive temenna is called into action, it seems as if a whole
chapter would scarcely suffice to describe them all. But we will
content ourselves with its demonstration upon the arrival of a guest
among a company of some fifteen or twenty persons.</p>
<p>As soon as the visitor is seated, the lady welcomes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name="pb249">249</a>]</span>her
guest by a temenna&mdash;which is acknowledged by the same signal, and
reiterated by each person in the company successively, according to her
rank.</p>
<p>Now another round commences. The lady of the house makes a new
temenna, which signifies, &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; Another temenna
from the visitor, is equivalent to an acknowledgment of thanks, who
with the same gesture, intimates a desire to know the state of her
hostess&rsquo;s health.</p>
<p>The whole company then in succession follow suit, to each of whom
the visitor replies in the same way.</p>
<p>This Quaker-meeting style of receiving company, might be ludicrously
illustrated in American society, by substituting bows for
temennas&mdash;if, indeed, the ladies could be expected to preserve the
requisite silence and gravity of demeanor.</p>
<p>In Turkey, every attention or compliment, brings its train of
temennas, and it is much to be regretted that no mathematician has yet
arisen in Turkey, capable of producing a regular formula for their
exact computation.</p>
<p>The <i>Meddahs</i>, however, or the famous story-tellers of the
East, who are the best critics, sometimes endeavor to exhibit the
danger of too great an excess in this act of politeness.</p>
<p>They say there was once a worthy <i lang="tr">Hodja</i> or
schoolmaster, who was very punctilious. Desirous that all <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>his
scholars should realise the importance of true politeness, he insisted
that when he drank water, not a single one of them should omit to
exclaim with a respectful temenna, <i lang="tr">afiyet olsoun hodja
efendy</i>, or may it do you much good, respected master&mdash;and when
he sneezed, they were all to clap their hands, and vociferate <i lang=
"tr">hayr ola hodja efendy</i>, or good luck to the master.</p>
<p>The means employed by this worthy schoolmaster to enforce his
lessons, may be readily guessed by others of the same profession; but
that the desired effect was produced, there is no doubt.</p>
<p>There was a deep well, from which the scholars had to draw water for
their own use.</p>
<p>One day, it was reported to the teacher that the bucket had fallen
in the well, who, after many vain attempts to fish it up, resolved to
descend by means of a rope, and the scholars were called upon to assist
in his descent and ascent.</p>
<p>The hodja was accordingly lowered down into the well, and at a given
signal, the boys began to pull him up. But as he approached the mouth
of the well, the change of the atmosphere titillating his nostrils,
unfortunately made him <i>sneeze</i>; when the well-trained pupils,
instinctively making the temenna, and clapping their hands, let go the
rope and shouted, &ldquo;<i lang="tr">hayr ola hodja efendy</i>,&rdquo;
good luck to the master. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href=
"#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span></p>
<p>But, <span lang="fr">retournons nous &agrave; nos
moutons</span>.</p>
<p>After the visitor is seated, and the usual temennas are exchanged,
long chibouks with amber mouthpieces, set in diamonds, are offered by
the <i lang="tr">halayiks</i> or slaves; after which, sweetmeats are
served upon a silver tray, with goblets of water, and then coffee.</p>
<p>This beverage is served in small porcelain cups, in stands of silver
or gold, sometimes enamelled and set in diamonds&mdash;which ceremony
is thus poetically described by Lord Byron:</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;And mocha&rsquo;s berry, from Arabia pure,</p>
<p class="line">In small fine china cups, came in at last;</p>
<p class="line">Gold cups of filagree, made to secure</p>
<p class="line">The hand from burning, underneath them
placed.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Although there are certain ceremonies which are never
omitted as matters of form, their intercourse with each other is most
unsophisticated. Mutual criticism, and inspection of toilets,
catechising about prices, etc., are indulged in as matters of course,
and if by chance the guest is a European lady, the scrutiny is the more
intense; so that those who desire to visit Turkish harems, must go
prepared to undergo the most thorough examination with smiles and good
humor; the only satisfaction being a genuine retaliation upon the fair
hanums, who would feel exceedingly flattered thereby, and by no means
dream of being offended<span class="corr" id="xd25e4245" title=
"Not in source">.</span> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href=
"#pb252" name="pb252">252</a>]</span></p>
<p>The whole establishment is shown to visitors, as one way of
entertaining them; and frequently they get up a dance among themselves,
or call in the dancing girls with their castanets.</p>
<p>Upon intimation of departure, sherbet is served; after which the
visit is terminated, and the guest reconducted in the same manner in
which she was<span class="gap" title=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">POLYGAMY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is true that a Harem is generally composed of an
assemblage of women, but <i>not</i> such as the public usually
imagine.</p>
<p>Although the Mussulmans are allowed by the Koran to have several
wives, there are few who have more than one, especially at the present
day; a fact not to be, however, attributed to any new code of morality,
but rather to the coercion of circumstances.</p>
<p>It was the practice of the Arabs to have eight or ten wives, whom
they were seldom able to maintain. Mohammed, wishing to remedy this
evil, and not altogether to abolish ancient usages, limited the
number&mdash;&ldquo;Take in marriage of such women as please you, two,
or three or four, and not more. But if ye fear that ye cannot act
equitably to so many, marry <i>only one</i>, or the slaves which ye
shall have acquired.&rdquo; They were allowed to marry a greater number
of slaves, as their dowry was much smaller, and they were maintained in
a very different style from the free women. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span></p>
<p>As the Osmanlis have a remarkable love of offspring, it often
happens that a man having had no children by a wife, and unwilling to
divorce her, which is considered discreditable, takes a second one in
imitation of Abraham and Jacob and many other patriarchs of old, whose
practices were but the type of the habits of all Oriental people, even
those of the present day. But such a step being often the source of
domestic difficulty, the substitution of a slave in the place of a
second wife is generally preferred&mdash;and such slaves are retained
in the harem with the appellation of <i>Odaluk</i> or handmaid, like
Hagar, Bilhah, and Zilpah. When these Odaluks become mothers, by right
of their maternity, they acquire their freedom and are considered
second wives.</p>
<p>A man may, however, be induced to contract a second marriage either
from mercenary or ambitious motives.</p>
<p>When circumstances or selfish inclinations induce the Mussulmans to
have several wives, they are obliged to assign to each one private
apartments and attendants. These ladies, although often living under
the same roof, visit each other with all the etiquette of perfect
strangers, and require an expenditure for retinue and accommodations,
which can only be sustained by wealth.</p>
<p>Besides all partiality being out of the question, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=
"pb255">255</a>]</span>there is great cause for jealousy among the
different members of such establishments&mdash;and the less favored
being ever ready for intrigue, conspire to render the husband most
miserable and the sanctuary a perfect bedlam, and the ambition of a
second wife sometimes can only be satisfied by the sacrifice of her
rival.</p>
<p>Fethi Ahmed Pasha was so favored by the sultan that his majesty
bestowed his sister upon him in marriage. Notwithstanding this alliance
with royalty, the wife and children of his humbler fortunes retained
their place in his memory; but he could only visit them in secret.</p>
<p>The author has, on several occasions, assisted to his incognito, as
he left his state barge and proceeded <i lang="fr">en bourgeois</i> in
a small cayik, to visit the house of his affections.</p>
<p>There is, therefore, every reason to believe that our Mussulman
friends will soon come to the conclusion, that,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Polygamy may well be held in dread,</p>
<p class="line">Not only as a sin, but as a <i>bore</i>:&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">Notwithstanding then the toleration of polygamy by the
Prophet, it is evident that circumstances have combined to restrict
this practice; and most particularly the abolition of the Circassian
slave-trade, to a certain extent, has created an effectual check to the
use of Odaluks&mdash;thus increasing the necessity of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb256" href="#pb256" name=
"pb256">256</a>]</span>alliances between the members of different
families which were formerly avoided; because the wife being surrounded
and supported by her own relations, attained an undue share of domestic
power and influence.</p>
<p>Especially when alliances are formed with royalty, the circumstances
are most aggravating. The husband then becomes an abject slave, and has
tacitly to submit to the caprices of his spouse.</p>
<p>He cannot enter the harem of his sultana unless especially sent for;
nor can he postpone his attendance to her summons no matter what his
circumstances or occupation may be.</p>
<p>The sultan&rsquo;s brother-in-law has often been seen, sleeping in a
corner of a sofa at the Selamluk, till two or three o&rsquo;clock in
the morning, awaiting the pleasure of his royal mistress&mdash;while
she on her part was amusing herself in the harem with dancing girls,
music, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The pasha&rsquo;s embarrassment has also been very evident when he
has been obliged to leave the company abruptly; no apology being
necessary on such occasions; the entrance of the sable messenger, with
a single temenna intimating the absolute command of the royal wife, who
generally dismisses her train of ladies and slaves before he makes his
appearance.</p>
<p>It is with the desire to avoid such petticoat government
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>that the young men do not contract alliances
with ladies of rank and distinction; preferring to marry their own
slaves, or to content themselves with the Odaluks which their mothers
bestow upon them to keep them within the home circle, and out of
mischief.</p>
<p>Sometimes they are forced to a second marriage by the bestowal of a
bride from a superior in power whose orders they cannot refuse.</p>
<p>A great number of women then in any harem is by no means a sure sign
of the uxorious disposition of its master, but is rather an indication
of his personal rank and wealth.</p>
<p>For the Osmanlis men and women are proverbially fond of display,
they say &ldquo;Sense belongs to Europe&mdash;wealth to India, beauty
to Georgia&mdash;but show and display are the attributes of the
Osmanlis alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They therefore delight in all the appendages of luxury, and surround
themselves with crowds of attendants. This Oriental propensity has even
been sustained by the Prophet himself, who says, that &ldquo;the very
meanest in Paradise will have 80,000 servants,&rdquo; &amp;c. While,
then, the gentleman in the selamluk, has his steward, treasurer,
cup-bearer, pipe bearer, etc., the Hanum on her part, has her own
appropriate suite, which is in many instances more numerous than that
of her Efendy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span></p>
<p>This is particularly true with regard to the sultanas or sisters and
daughters of the sultan, whose husbands are not allowed to behold the
faces of any of the fair maidens in the royal train, except by special
permission of the sultanas themselves. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h2 class="main">MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Marriage is considered &ldquo;honorable in all,&rdquo;
but most especially among the Osmanlis, who enter into this condition
as they arrive at the age of puberty. The independent state of
bachelorship is therefore unknown among them, or if such an accident
should happen, the unfortunate gentleman is styled <i lang=
"tr">beekear</i><span class="corr" id="xd25e4345" title=
"Source: .">,</span> or useless member of society, which stigma it is
needless to say they by no means covet; as for old maids, there is not
a word in the language descriptive of that class of women.</p>
<p>The preliminaries of all marriages are effected by the parents, who
not only thus spare their children much trouble and embarrassment, but
use all their own wisdom and experience of genuine terrestrial
happiness in providing for their own offspring. Besides, parental
authority is supreme, and filial obedience equally innate, hence it
never enters into the calculations of the young to weary themselves
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>with the anticipatory illusions of love, though
sometimes when old enough they join in the matrimonial
deliberations.</p>
<p>Marriage is not a religious, but rather a civil contract among the
Mussulmans, and the ceremony is as simple as in Protestant
countries.</p>
<p>This ceremony which is called <i>Nikeah</i>, is effected by proxies,
and there is always a fixed sum settled upon the bride, according to
the condition of the party. This <i>Nikeah</i> constitutes the legal
marriage, but the bride does not go to her husband&rsquo;s home until
three or four months have elapsed, at which time the friends assemble
to partake of the nuptial festivities, which continue during four days,
and always end on Thursday, as the following day is the Turkish
sabbath.</p>
<p>Upon her arrival, the bride is met at the door of the harem, and
conducted into the room by the bridegroom himself, who carries her up
stairs in his arms, and placing her in the most honorable part of the
sofa, raises her veil of tinsel, and takes the liberty, for the first
time, to gaze upon the features of his beloved.</p>
<p>Separate establishments are almost unknown in Turkey. The bride goes
to the house of her husband&rsquo;s parents, so that the family circle
often becomes very numerous. It occasionally happens <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name="pb261">261</a>]</span>that
by special request, the bridegroom enters the family of his
wife&rsquo;s parents; which, however, is considered a misfortune, for
they say, &ldquo;<i lang="tr">Itch guveyeeden halludja</i>&rdquo; or
any condition is preferable to that of a man married into a family.</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">DIVORCE.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Voltaire has observed, &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Le
divorce est probablement de la m&ecirc;me date &agrave; peu pr&egrave;s
que le mariage; je crois, pourtant, que le mariage est de quelques
semaines plus ancien; c&rsquo;est &agrave; dire qu&rsquo;on se querella
avec sa femme au bout de quinze jours, qu&rsquo;on se battit au bout
d&rsquo;un mois, et qu&rsquo;on s&rsquo;en s&eacute;para apr&egrave;s
six semaines de cohabitation.</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>If such be a true picture of human nature, it is not too highly
drawn for a country where polygamy is practised, since it is no hard
matter for a man to part with one wife, when he has several others. The
privilege of divorce would be somewhat tyrannical if allowed only to
the men, but in Turkey, the women themselves may exercise this
prerogative, if they are maltreated, or not properly provided for, with
at least the requisite &ldquo;bread and candles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man may put away his wife merely by uttering in the hearing of a
third party, the ominous word &ldquo;bosh,&rdquo; <span class="corr"
id="xd25e4383" title="Source: nul">null</span>, void, which even if
carelessly spoken <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262"
name="pb262">262</a>]</span>renders the man and wife strangers to each
other, the lady feeling obliged to assume her veil, and conceal her
charms; and in case of reconciliation, a second marriage ceremony is
necessary. The woman, on her part, has the privilege of leaving her
husband, by declaring before the Cadi, <i lang="tr">Djanum azad,
nikeahum helal</i>&mdash;I forfeit my dowry, and claim my freedom.</p>
<p>It is fortunate that divorce is very disreputable, and is seldom
practised by either party if they have any respect for public opinion,
or regard for themselves; otherwise, wives and husbands would be
constantly changing hands, as was the practice among the old Arabs, in
the time of Mohammed.</p>
<p>This custom was decried by the Prophet, &ldquo;It shall not be
lawful for thee to take other women to wife hereafter, nor to exchange
any of thy wives for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The moral effect of a facility of divorce is to keep both parties on
their good behavior, but at the same time a spirit of extreme
selfishness is induced in the women. For being in constant apprehension
of a sudden separation, they look upon their husbands as a means of
revenue, and endeavor to store up as much jewelry, clothing etc., as
possible, to be ready in case of emergency. The display of shawls and
diamonds upon the persons of women, even of the poorest classes, is not
from a feeling of vanity, but rather an <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span>exhibition of the
extent of the personal wealth they have extorted from their lords and
masters.</p>
<p>In case of separation, the children are supported until they are
seven years old, by the father; after which the boys remain under the
paternal care, and the girls belong to the mother; unless some other
arrangement is made by mutual consent.</p>
<p>The most unjust stigma of illegitimacy, is almost unknown in Turkey;
the children by slaves being as respectable and legitimate as those by
the regular wives, and it is only when the father cannot be discovered
that they are regarded as bastards. Such principles are certainly
right, and more humane than those of Christian lands, where the
innocent are taunted all their lifetime with the immoralities of
others, for whose actions they are as irresponsible as &ldquo;the babe
unborn.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE SULTAN&rsquo;S HAREM.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Although there are more than 2,000 women in the
palace, but five of these hold the rank of <i>kaduns</i>, or wives.</p>
<p>Mussulmans, in general, are allowed to have four wives, but sultans
can have <i>seven</i>.</p>
<p>Their superiority to ordinary men is thus attested, and the chance
made surer of an heir to the throne.</p>
<p>It will, therefore, be perceived that polygamy, in the case of a
sultan, is a matter of policy, and not choice; for even should he
content himself with one wife, the State would interfere.</p>
<p>The design of limiting his majesty&rsquo;s wives to seven, is to
spare the State the enormous expense attendant upon the maintenance of
so many ladies of royal rank.</p>
<p>The present sultan, however, in asserting his prerogative, has
limited the number to five, which, while it shows his power to exceed
the restrictions <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265"
name="pb265">265</a>]</span>upon other Mussulmans, at the same time,
displays an inclination not to burden the State too heavily with his
private expenses.</p>
<p>It is true he has had children by several others, whom custom
requires to be elevated to the rank of kaduns, but he has retained them
under the title of <i>ikbals</i>, or favorites, for the sake of sparing
the State the additional expense which the dignity of kaduns would
require.</p>
<p>The sultan being above all law, cannot submit to any matrimonial
bondage; he is not, therefore, <i>legally</i> married to any of his
wives, but those who are selected by him to share his affections, are
pronounced by him <i>Kaduns</i>, or ladies, and not sultanas; for none
but those of the royal blood can enjoy that title, except the mother of
the reigning sultan, who on her son&rsquo;s accession to the throne,
takes, by courtesy, this title, and is called Valid&eacute; Sultan.</p>
<p>The title Sultan is equally applied to males and females, with this
difference only, that it precedes the name of the male, and follows
that of the female: thus, they say Sultan Abd-ul-Medjid, but for his
sister, Adil&eacute; Sultan.</p>
<p>When it is used by itself, it always implies the female branch of
the royal family, and never his majesty, who is known by the title of
Padishah, or H&uuml;nkear, or, in common parlance, Efendimiz&mdash;our
Lord. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span></p>
<p>His majesty never forming an alliance with any of his subjects, all
his kaduns are originally Georgian or Circassian slaves, who are
selected for this distinguished honor and presented to him by his
mother or sisters, on <i>Kadir Gedjessy</i>, or the night in which the
Koran descended from Heaven.</p>
<p>They have each their separate establishments and retinue in the
palace, and live as much apart as if in different dwellings, seldom
seeing each other, except on occasions of state ceremony and
etiquette.</p>
<p>The princes of the royal blood also reside in the same palace, who,
if of age, have their own odaluks, attendants, etc.</p>
<p>It may be supposed, that in such a royal establishment, the rising
generation is well represented; but on the contrary, few of them are
allowed to prolong their lives, while many more never see the
light.</p>
<p>This premature destruction of life, though strictly prohibited in
the Koran, is very prevalent in Turkey. In some cases from
<i>State-Policy</i>, lest the heirs to the crown should become too
numerous, and in others, from a false desire in the ladies to preserve
their beauty and freshness from the toils and trial of maternity.</p>
<p>But very often the better feelings of their natures are sorely
tried, and two of the sisters of the present sultan pined away in
sorrow, and at last died, because <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267"
href="#pb267" name="pb267">267</a>]</span>their infant sons were
sacrificed upon the altar of state-policy!</p>
<p>Abd-ul-Medjid himself, in his younger days, was not exempt from
trials of this sort. For just before coming to the throne, he had a
favorite odaluk, to whom he was much attached. But as the princes are
not permitted to become fathers, she fell a victim in the attempt to
frustrate the probable birth of an heir, when a single week&rsquo;s
delay would have elevated her to the rank of first kadun to the
reigning monarch; for sultan Mahmoud died a few days after she was
sacrificed.</p>
<p>Whenever a child is born to the sultan, or any other Oriental
father, the tidings are immediately communicated to him and the family
relatives, and the messenger handsomely rewarded. Among the Mussulmans
the father himself pronounces the future name of his offspring at the
moment of its birth.</p>
<p>A certain man, having scarce passed the honeymoon, for he had only
been married three months, one day, while he was in the bath, was
suddenly apprised of the birth of a son and heir. As soon as he
recovered from his surprise at such an unexpected event, he ordered him
to be named <i>Tchapgun</i> or racer, because, said he, he has
accomplished in three months, the customary labor of nine.</p>
<p>They have a singular notion that the reason a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>child cries as soon as it is born is, because
his satanic majesty being of course present, cruelly <i>pinches</i> the
tender offshoot of humanity; the only exception on record, being the
Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ, who were protected from the touch of the
devil by a veil, so placed by Allah himself; thus, doubtless,
accounting for the Immaculacy of the Holy Virgin.</p>
<p>The children, at their birth, are rubbed down with salt, and nicely
bandaged. They are placed in a cradle and secured there. The hands and
feet are bound in, so that the child cannot move. The poor little
victim becomes black and blue under this treatment, and is occasionally
relieved from its fetters to be re-enveloped in swaddling clothes; and
when the toilet is completed, it very much resembles a little Egyptian
mummy.</p>
<p>The child is nursed while lying down, the mother bending over it,
and tilting the cradle, until she attains the requisite position.</p>
<p>Owing to the bandages in which the infants are constantly enveloped,
the circulation of the blood is impeded, and they are obliged to be
relieved by occasional scarifications, and the writer still wears the
honorable scars of this traditional practice.</p>
<p>When the sultan wends his steps from the Mabeyn to the Harem, the
black gentlemen on guard at the door of the ladies&rsquo; apartments,
proceed immediately <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269"
name="pb269">269</a>]</span>to announce his majesty&rsquo;s approach to
the <i>Haznadar-Ousta</i>, or the lady treasuress.</p>
<p>This personage, is a very important character in the royal
household; being the keeper of all the jewels and other treasures, and
the mistress of ceremonies; she is, in a word&mdash;</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;That dame who keeps up discipline among</p>
<p class="line">The general ranks, so that none stir or talk</p>
<p class="line">Without her sanction on their she-parades:</p>
<p class="line">Her title is, the mother of the maids.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">There is always one of these Haznadars attached to the
harems of the wealthy; and the individual who fills this office, has
been the nurse of the head of the family in infancy; so that this
&ldquo;mother of the maids&rdquo; feels almost a maternal interest in
his majesty&rsquo;s happiness.</p>
<p>The Haznadar-Ousta immediately proceeds to the <i>salon</i>, where
she awaits the entrance of the sultan, who, after receiving her
salutations, in the course of conversation, inquires after the health
of one of the Kaduns, which is taken as an indication that her company
is desired by his majesty.</p>
<p>This Kadun now enters the royal presence alone, or perhaps with one
of her children, while her train of attendants remain within call. Like
all other Orientals, the Padishah delights in the company of his
children, and they are often seen in public with him, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>or
in the royal Mabeyn. His first-born was a daughter, and lately married
to Aali-Ghalib Pasha, the son of Reshid.</p>
<p>The children of the sultan precede their mother in rank, for they
are of royal blood, while she is but a slave.</p>
<p>Hence the mother always takes a secondary position in cayiks,
carriages, or in the saloon of reception. This apparent superiority
never elates the children, nor in any way lessens the respect which
they feel for their mothers. For whilst they are flattered and
worshipped as <i lang="tr">Shah-zad&eacute;s</i> and <i>Sultans</i>, or
Princes and Princesses, the general deference paid to their mothers is
undiminished. They have a proverb which is very expressive of their
feelings on this subject,</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<div lang="tr" class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Dagh kadar babam olajaghina,</p>
<p class="line">Y&uuml;ks&uuml;k kadar anam ola.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="lg">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Rather than a father the size of a mountain,</p>
<p class="line">Give me a mother, small as a thimble.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="first">The late Valid&eacute;-Sultan, or mother of the
sultan, was one of the most powerful individuals in the realm, and her
patronage most assiduously courted.</p>
<p>His majesty and his harem are frequently entertained with the
graceful movements and merry castanets of the dancing girls. The
Osmanlis are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>very fond of dancing, but consider it
inconsistent with their own dignity; they always have beautiful young
slaves trained in this accomplishment, and also made proficient in the
music of the country.</p>
<p>Turkish music is very unlike that of European countries, where there
is a general similarity. Although the Orientals have very good ears for
music, and treat the subject scientifically, yet it is strange that
they do not understand the harmony of sounds&mdash;for all their
concerts, both vocal and instrumental, consist of <i>solos</i>, that
is, they all sing and play only the air or tenor, and never the bass
and contralto, etc.</p>
<p>The natural tones of their voices are very sweet; and of late years
the military music having been arranged in European style, they have
made great proficiency in this art.</p>
<p>The opera house in Pera is also very attractive to the Turkish
gentlemen, and much frequented by them. The sultan has his <i>loge</i>,
or box there, and sometimes honors the house by his royal presence.</p>
<p>Recently the piano has also become very fashionable among them, and
it is to be heard incessantly jingling in all the harems. The sultan
being himself an amateur, frequently plays on that instrument, and has
also an Italian Opera attached to his palace for the entertainment of
his ladies, where many of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272"
href="#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>female slaves are trained to
sing and act <i lang="fr">&agrave; la Italienne</i>, in the costumes of
both sexes.</p>
<p>The ladies of the palace are also amused with other exhibitions,
which they witness through latticed partitions.</p>
<p>From the preceding sketch, it will be readily understood, that all
the ladies in the royal palace, are in reality <i>slaves</i> from the
regions of Circassia, but they are always well treated, and even
addressed by the title of Hanums, or ladies; and we may say their
greatest hardship is being lightly clothed all seasons of the year;
their feet without stockings, and their dresses made of the lightest
fabrics, from which fact many of them fall easy victims to
consumption.</p>
<p>These ladies are not allowed to go abroad as freely as Turkish
hanums in general, on account of the restrictions of court etiquette;
this confinement is also very injurious to their health, and their
ennui is often insupportable. Sometimes, after a due warning to all the
gardeners and other gentlemen to quit the premises, they are allowed to
stroll in the palace gardens, and occasionally the Valid&eacute; Sultan
takes pity on some of them, and permits them to enjoy a promenade in
her own train, when the exuberance of their spirits often tempts them
to the most childish acts of coquetry. Indeed, so great is their
longing to encounter the lords of creation, that a feigned sickness
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span>affords an occasion of seeing a doctor, and
their favorite remedy for all ailments is bleeding, or the
<i>bleeder</i>!</p>
<p>These beautiful girls having no other ambition than to be as
fascinating as possible, and such aspirations sometimes seem to be felt
in more enlightened bosoms, they do not like to waste their sweetness
on the desert air; as they are consequently a little mischievous, the
practice of locking up each one in her own apartments has been deemed
advisable. When the muezzin proclaims the hour of evening prayer, the
disconsolate ladies are severally consigned to a state of security by
the sable turnkeys of the palace.</p>
<p>This is not, however, so dismal a fate, when we remember that a
short time ago, all the inhabitants of Stamboul were obliged to be
within their own domiciles, about two hours after sunset; and awhile
since, there was the curfew bell even in good old England. <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<h2 class="main">CIRCASSIAN SLAVES.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Although the slave trade has been nominally abolished
in Turkey, and the public mart formally closed to this traffic, yet the
practice of buying and selling has not been, nor will it ever be
altogether abandoned, because the slave constitutes an essential
element in the composition of their domestic institutions.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of servitude in every house; one, the ordinary
labor of domestic service; the other that of personal attendance;
neither of which the free Mussulman women are willing to perform,
because they will thereby be more or less brought in contact with men,
which is proscribed by the Koran. The slave service, therefore, becomes
necessarily indispensable with the Mussulmans, whose houses have
hitherto been supplied with Circassian and Nubian slaves, the former
being a species of ladies <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href=
"#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>in waiting, and the latter
performing the menial services of the household.</p>
<p>The average price of the slaves is, according to the tariff of the
Custom-house, $500 for the white, and $100 for the black. They bring
these prices when they arrive fresh from their native lands. Those of
the Circassian, who are, however, brought into the country in
childhood, and carefully educated and trained in accomplishments,
attain so rare a style of beauty and delicacy of appearance that they
are frequently sold for $6,000 or $8,000.</p>
<p>Though the restrictions upon the trade have forced Turkish families
to employ Greek and Armenian women in their houses, yet there is always
a demand for slaves.</p>
<p>The Armenians having the same institution as the Mussulmans, viz.,
the harem, their maidens are prevented from entering any family as
servants; it is only the old women, whose charms have all faded and
gone, who are willing to expose themselves in this way. The Greeks,
though not so scrupulous, are generally ignorant of the Turkish
language, and altogether uncongenial in their habits and ideas, so that
they are unpopular.</p>
<p>Slaves are still more indispensable in the palace, for the Mussulman
prejudice is opposed to the introduction of any of the subjects who
would thus come <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276"
name="pb276">276</a>]</span>in contact with royalty. Besides, is his
majesty to form an alliance with his subjects?</p>
<p>The Circassian parents so long accustomed to the benefits derived by
the advancement of their daughters to positions of comparative ease,
will always be ready and anxious to supply the metropolis; and the
traffic, notwithstanding the formal prohibition, is still continued at
private houses in Top-han&eacute;. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb277"
href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span></p>
<p>Circassian slavery in Turkey, is not a condition of servitude. All
the children who are born from odaluks are free, and they also render
their mothers free; an odaluk may be sold alone, but never after she
has become a mother.</p>
<p>Besides the maids of honor or ladies in waiting, at the palace, are
often bestowed in marriage upon pashas and other dignitaries, who thus
consider themselves in some sense allied to royalty. One of their
number was a slave to Valid&eacute; Sultan. She was married to Mehmed
Bey, the brother of the sultan&rsquo;s brother-in-law, with the idea of
ameliorating her condition; but being very ill-treated by her husband,
she had a petition written and presented it to her royal patroness,
whereupon the valid&eacute; summoned the husband, and reprimanded him
in such a manner that he became exasperated, and having intoxicated
himself with <i>racky</i>, or Turkish brandy, rushed into the harem,
and plunged his dagger into the breast of the unfortunate wife.</p>
<p>Sultan Mahmoud lost his favorite wife, and was so much grieved by
her death, that he ordered her apartments to be locked up, and that no
one should enter them; he only, spent some time there every day in
solitary meditation upon his lost favorite.</p>
<p>There was a slave girl fourteen or fifteen years old, whose duty was
to clean the bath belonging to these <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb278" href="#pb278" name="pb278">278</a>]</span>apartments. She was
so curious to know why these rooms were always locked up, that she one
day found herself on an exploring expedition by means of the private
staircase. Finding the door open, she ventured to enter the apartment,
when, lo! and behold! there was the awful Mahmoud himself.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;how dare you venture here; do you not know my
express commands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The terrified girl fell at his majesty&rsquo;s feet, and craved
pardon.</p>
<p>She was so bewitching in this posture, that the sultan not only
pardoned her, but invited her to meet him every day in the same place,
till at last, he ordered that the apartments should be appropriated to
her, and she became the Fifth Kadun, and the mother of the present
sultan!</p>
<p>It is the idea of aspiring to such honors and stations, near even
royalty itself, which induces the Circassian parents so readily to sell
their daughters to Mussulmans, when nothing could induce them to barter
their offspring to Christians.</p>
<p>No wonder that each simple peasant of the Caucasus fancies slavery
in the metropolis, to be a translation from poverty to an earthly
elysium, when tales, and true tales too, not the enchantments of
Aladdin&rsquo;s wonderful lamp, are so common in Oriental life!</p>
<p>Therefore, even if the traffic is formally prohibited, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span>the
Circassian parents will force their offspring into the market, not only
to ameliorate their condition, but to secure favorable alliances for
themselves; so that if the legal sum be not hereafter realized as
purchase money, their children will still be apprenticed in some way or
other. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=

<h2 class="main">WATERING PLACES.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p>There is a prevalent impression that the Turkish ladies are always
imprisoned at home; but nothing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281"
href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>is more erroneous. For, since
the destruction of the janissaries, who molested every one in public,
they are to be seen everywhere, and on all occasions.</p>
<p>The only requisite for their appearance is to be veiled, and to wear
the Feradj&eacute;, or cloak.</p>
<p>Thus accoutred, they wander through the bazaars, frequent all rural
places of resort, visit the baths, and scarcely a day passes when they
stay at home. Nor <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282" href="#pb282"
name="pb282">282</a>]</span>is it to be supposed that they are closely
muffled, as they were formerly. The ancient out-door costume was most
hideous; they were enveloped in an immense white sheet, a little piece
of horse-hair gauze being suspended over the eyes. But the
<i>yashmak</i> or veil, is, at the present day, composed of the
lightest India mull, and has little power of concealing their charms,
but on the contrary, serves to heighten their beauty by its gossamer
transparency.</p>
<p>The arched eyebrows, through this deceptive veil, seem more
delicately curved; the large and lustrous eyes shine more darkly from
its snowy folds; and the delicate and peach-like hue of the complexion
is rendered tenfold more lovely.</p>
<p>The texture of the yashmak is now so exquisitely fine, that the two
square yards of muslin which compose it do not weigh more than a single
drachm!</p>
<p>The feradj&eacute; or cloak is an ample outer garment, made of fine
colored bombazine or Thibet, lined with silk, and the edges are trimmed
with embroidery.</p>
<p>Their feet are clothed with yellow <i>chedik</i>, or morocco
buskins, over which <i>paboudj</i>, or slippers of the same color, are
worn in the street.</p>
<p>So great is the force of habit and education, that not even the
oldest woman ever appears in public unveiled, although the Koran
pronounces furrows <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283"
name="pb283">283</a>]</span>and wrinkles to be all-sufficient disguises
for faded charms; yet, in Turkey, as well as all over the world, the
maxim doubtless is popular, that beauty never dies.</p>
<p>Even the dames of ebony hue, dreading the display of darkness
visible, are most punctilious in covering their charms, thus affording
more distinguished specimens of the wonderful effects of light and
shade.</p>
<p>During visits of ceremony, when the feradj&eacute; and yashmak are
taken off, a long strip of white muslin is left hanging from the top of
the head down the back, for the purpose of covering the face in case of
sudden emergency. But such accidents seldom occur, as the gentlemen of
the family are informed, as soon as they enter the vestibule of the
harem, that there are strangers within.</p>
<p>Thus equipped, the Osmanli ladies are the most independent creatures
in the world.</p>
<p>As no one dares to look them in the face, from a sense of respect,
it has been customary for them slightly to encourage their timid
admirers by a few furtive glances, if not positive attacks; so that, on
all public occasions, an attentive observer may detect them in some of
the wiles of coquetry, or unmeaning flirtation.</p>
<p>Ladies of distinction are attended by black <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>eunuchs, who protect them from the too familiar
approach of any witless knight, who may ignorantly trespass the limits
of Oriental decorum.</p>
<p>These ebony gentry, from the nature of their position, had become
insolent and overbearing, under the plea of protecting the ladies, and
a native always avoided a collision with them, since they were
sustained by public opinion. But their own extravagant conduct has put
an end to their pretensions and power.</p>
<p>Kizlar Aghassy, or the head black eunuch of the palace, was formerly
so influential a personage as to rank among the ministers of state; but
at the present time, the eunuchs have lost all their pristine
greatness, and are mere domestics of the household.</p>
<p>The carriage generally used by the ladies is called an <i>araba</i>,
which is often very richly ornamented and gilded, and well cushioned in
the inside. The top is covered with a crimson or green <i>ehram</i> or
shaggy cloth, manufactured in Albania, and fringed with gold. This
spacious conveyance, capable of accommodating six or eight persons, has
no springs, and is drawn by a couple of oxen, whose heads are gaily
tricked out, and furnished with a charm against the Evil-Eye. The ends
of the tails are tied to a cluster of red tassels, which are fastened
to a hoop set in the yoke, and gracefully arched over their backs. This
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>arrangement is to prevent the animals from
spattering the mud with their tails.</p>
<p>The araba is entered by means of a small temporary ladder at the
back. There is a conductor, or arabagee, who leads the oxen by a chain
attached to their heads, and a yanashma, or boy, who walks by the side,
and goads them on.</p>
<p>But many of the families are now to be seen in public, in European
carriages, and they delight in excursions on the water in their
beautiful <i>cayiks</i>.</p>
<p>Nature has been so lavish in her gifts to the land of the Osmanlis,
that they have every temptation to linger for hours in some one of the
many lovely spots which are to be found all along the Bosphorus.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span></p>
<p><i lang="tr">Boghas-itchy</i> or the Bosphorus, is the most
magnificent stream in the world. Its winding way, its shores
besprinkled with palaces, mosques and minar&eacute;&rsquo;s, in the
peculiar picturesque style of the East; the gradually sloping hills,
here and there studded with airy and pretty dwellings, and decked out
in green array&mdash;all combine to enchant the eye and delight the
mind.</p>
<p>There is nothing so exquisite as the <i>cayiks</i> of the Bosphorus.
Their forms are as slender as the canoe&rsquo;s, and certainly more
graceful than the gondola&rsquo;s, defying any other aquatic conveyance
rowed by men. They are always propelled by long <i>sculls</i> of one,
two, or three pair, fastened on the gunnels at about midships, to pins,
by leather bands.</p>
<p>The hold is allotted to the accommodation of passengers; there you
recline amid downy cushions, and noiselessly glide along, with the
measured oars of the boatmen, who look like very sea-nymphs, in their
snow-white robes.</p>
<p>By moonlight, the shores, with their latticed and <span class=

realms in the distance; and the blue waters reflecting back the silvery
stars, almost tempt one to plunge beneath their glassy surface. No
wonder, then, that the Osmanlis should spend most of their time, when
the summer sun cheers and invigorates, in loitering among such scenes
as these.</p>
<p>The sultan has numerous <i>kiosks</i> of his own; on the most lofty
summits of the hills, in the most sweetly embosomed valleys, by the
margin of the briny sea, where wave after wave has &ldquo;noiselessly
rolled up the beach&rdquo; ever since the waters which were above the
firmament were divided from those below&mdash;in the midst of plains,
by the roadside, and in the noisy populous streets of the metropolis,
are these tasteful pleasure bowers ever to be met with, but carefully
guarded from profane footsteps. Generally, however, in the spots thus
consecrated by royal pleasure, are to be found coffee shops, and mats
or low stools, for the accommodation of other classes of this
nature-loving multitude, where at all times the most lovely groups of
men, women, and children are collected.</p>
<p>There are some places of resort more frequented than others. The
Kehat-han&eacute;, or as it is commonly known to Europeans the
&ldquo;Sweet-waters of Europe,&rdquo; at the head of the Golden Horn,
Fener-Bahchessy, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288"
name="pb288">288</a>]</span>or, the garden of the Light House, and Moda
Bournou, or the Fashionable Point, on the Marmora, the Ge&ouml;k-Souyou
or the Heavenly Waters of Asia, on the Bosphorus, Hunkear-Iskellesy or
the Sultan&rsquo;s Valley&mdash;and Kalender on the opposite shore.</p>
<p>To all of these places, the people flock in cayiks and carriages,
and spreading their carpets upon the green sward, recline with true
Oriental nonchalance and comfort. The chibouk adds its curling fumes to
the scene, the narghill&eacute; bubbles in unison, the favorite
kahv&eacute; is handed round in tiny cups, the wild notes of the
<i>Lahouta</i> and <i>Kementch&eacute;</i> are re-echoed by the verdant
hills, while an entire lamb on a spit sheds <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name="pb289">289</a>]</span>its
fragrant odors, predicting a pic-nic <i lang="fr">champ&ecirc;tre</i>.
The itinerant seller of bon-bons plants his tray before you, and you
cannot refuse to partake of its luscious contents&mdash;wandering
gipsies present you wild flowers, and proffer their services in
unfolding the pages of destiny. Group after group glides along in the
fanciful costumes of Stamboul, and all are joyous and contented.</p>
<p>Thus the Osmanlis enjoy that sensation of delight, their
indescribable <i>Kief</i>, when for the moment all care and trouble are
forgotten, amid the scenes of beauty which nature so freely lavishes
upon all, rich and poor.</p>
<p>Especially on a Friday, or the Mohammedan Sunday, there are
congregated thousands of persons, people from every clime, and of every
rank&mdash;Persians in their peaked <i>papakhs</i>; Albanians with
their fustanels; Circassians in their woolly caps; Zeybeks, or Turkish
mountaineers, in gay costumes and lofty head-gear, and armed from head
to foot; strange men on horse-back, who seem to be made up of gold
embroidery and cashmere shawls; Turkish soldiers, and ebony negroes on
milk-white steeds; the representatives of the different western powers
in their elegant carriages, with their own ladies and families;
European travellers and book-making authors, mingle in the crowd. The
imported beauties of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290"
name="pb290">290</a>]</span>Circassia, sit on their embroidered
cushions, sable guards patroling around, while their lords and masters
keep at a respectful distance.</p>
<p>The Osmanli ladies seem all to be beautiful, especially in their
white and delicate veils, and costumes of such varied hues, with
brilliant diamonds glittering <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291"
href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>upon their heads, necks,
arms, and fingers&mdash;in a word, a Turkish watering-place would
eclipse even Broadway itself in recherch&eacute;es toilettes and
unparalleled beauty; while the charm of such an endless variety
furnishes a study for the artist, and leaves nothing to be desired to
complete a picture exquisitely perfect.</p>
<p>Amid such scenes as these, the blue heavens for a canopy, with
nature&rsquo;s emerald carpeting, the tall and majestic trees bearing
the impress of unnumbered seasons, more beautiful in their leafy
verdure than the most exquisitely carved and marble columns of the
palaces of kings; while the tuneful songsters of the grove trill their
plaintive notes&mdash;are displayed the simple tastes and habits of
this people, so inaccessible when they are once within the precincts of
their own domiciles.</p>
<p>Here may the stranger, who for the first time treads the shores of
the Eastern world, perceive the real spirit of Oriental society and
manners, as exhibited in the exchange of mutual intercourse and the
etiquettes of life.</p>
<p>The group just before you may be the harem of an Armenian banker.
Though composed of many ladies, yet the Armenians being Christians, by
virtue of their religion, they are not allowed to number more than
<i>one</i> wife in their harems. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb292"
href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span></p>
<p>Again, under the shadow of yonder tree, are two lovely Mussulman
girls, surrounded by a train of halayiks, or female slaves, and
attended by black eunuchs. Stay your footsteps, for it is the harem of
&mdash;&mdash; Efendy&mdash;a Redjal or grandee of the realm.</p>
<p>This distinguished man had the misfortune to lose his interesting
and beloved wife; and so strong was her memory upon his heart, that he
never sought to replace her loss; consoling himself with these two
beautiful pledges of her love, and lavishing upon them all his
affection and indulgence.</p>
<p>These young ladies alone now constitute <i>the harem</i> of a man
who has perfect freedom to number as many as <i>four</i> lawful
wives!</p>
<p>Thus it may be perceived, how far from being synonymous are the two
words Harem and Polygamy. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE BAZAARS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The bazaars of Constantinople are built of stone, and
lighted from the top. They seem like long streets covered with arched
roofs, each street being appropriated to some particular merchandise;
thus, there are the spice bazaar, where all kinds of condiments, drugs,
and dye stuffs are sold; the perfumery bazaar, containing the most
delicious perfumes of the East, the otto of roses, Tcherkess-souyou,
and many other essences, also the fragrant pastilles, which are placed
upon the pipe bowls, filling the atmosphere with their delicious scent,
and the singular rat&rsquo;s tails which emit a perfume like musk, and
retain their odor for any length of time; the silk bazaar, the calico
bazaar, the shoe bazaar, depots of most varied and exquisite
embroideries; the jewelry bazaar, the pipe bazaar, where are displayed
the beautiful and costly mouthpieces studded with gems, the long and
graceful stems of jessamine, or cherry, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb294" href="#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>and the gilded and
delicately modelled red clay bowls.</p>
<p>The space occupied by these bazaars is equal to the whole of the
sixth ward in the city of New York, and the internal arrangements are
entirely unlike the shops of this country. There are no front windows,
nor counters. The entire fa&ccedil;ade of the streets being shelved for
the display of wares and goods, presents a whole front with the
appearance of a vast library, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb295"
href="#pb295" name="pb295">295</a>]</span>not of books, but of
merchandise. A sort of elevated platform, about five or six feet wide,
and two feet from the ground, extends the whole side, on which both
merchants and customers sit, thus serving the double purpose of counter
and seats. The shops are divided by elbow boards, and a small room is
attached behind each for the storage of goods, etc.</p>
<p>The ends of the streets are furnished with immense gates, which are
closed every evening about an hour before sunset, and are opened again
in the morning about eight.</p>
<p>The whole effect is very interesting; the fanciful wares, the great
number and proximity of the stalls or shops, and the varied costumes of
the venders and purchasers, combine to create rare and beautiful groups
for the pencil of the artist. Carriages, horses, and foot-passengers,
are continually passing and re-passing in crowds.</p>
<p>Occasionally the owners of the shops are obliged to leave their
merchandise for a short time, and during their absence, a covering of
net-work suspended across the front of the stall, is sufficient to
indicate the absence of the proprietor, and also to protect the
property from all depredation.</p>
<p>These bazaars are the favorite resort of the Turkish ladies of all
ranks, and there is no little coquetry displayed by the fair
purchasers, when the unusually <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296"
href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>handsome appearance of the
merchant tempts them literally to ransack his whole establishment for
the most trifling article. These occasions are also made available for
the purposes of flirtation, assignation, and all other romantic
amusements. It is amusing to observe the ladies as they fit themselves
with their peculiarly colored and shaped chaussure, for they make no
scruple of displaying their beautiful ankles, which are generally
divested of every semblance of hosiery.</p>
<p>The method of buying and selling is peculiar to the country, and
doubtless very entertaining to strangers. The system of Prix-Fix, is
unknown in Turkey, for, as they go on the principle &ldquo;each one for
himself,&rdquo; no one is content with any price except his own
valuation. Besides, the people are so conceited that any concession on
the part of the merchant is flattering to their vanity. He, therefore
enjoys the privilege of being beaten down, merely as complimentary to
his customers. So the merchant always demands an exorbitant price,
which he has no idea of receiving, in order to give his customer a fair
chance to gratify his vanity, and also to exercise his judgment.</p>
<p>As London has its &ldquo;Whitechapel Road,&rdquo; Paris its
&ldquo;Temple,&rdquo; and New York its &ldquo;Chatham street,&rdquo; so
Constantinople has its &ldquo;Bit-Bazaar,&rdquo; emphatically so
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>denominated from the vermin which infest old
clothing.</p>
<p>Infinite diversity pervades the garments here displayed, and as
people&rsquo;s clothes always look something like themselves, so the
empty garments seem to tell tales of their good or bad fortunes,
whether the former owners died of plague or small pox, were solitary
occupants of the robes, or shared them with other animalcul&aelig;.</p>
<p>At the auction, which occurs every day in these purlieus, poverty
may find a momentary relief by the disposal of its surplus wardrobe, or
may even don the cast off rags of some less fortunate victim of
misery.</p>
<p>There is a more respectable auction at the <i lang="tr">Bezesten</i>
every day except Friday, until noon, where jewelry, embroideries,
carpets, arms, and all sorts of superior second-hand garments are
disposed of. Here the humblest citizen may at least enjoy the semblance
of grandeur, as he invests himself in the same <i>setry</i> which the
Efendi discarded the day before; or an ambitious mother may procure the
same <i lang="fr">toilette de noces</i> as graced the form of a
beautiful Hanum.</p>
<p>The Bezesten is a large quadrangular stone building, surmounted by a
cupola, in the centre of the bazaars, and serves not only as a place of
public <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href="#pb298" name=
"pb298">298</a>]</span>auction, but for the safe deposit of valuable
property, either money, shawls, or jewelry.</p>
<p>There are numerous <i>khans</i> in the city, which are constructed
in the form of a hollow square, and are two or three stories in height.
The various rooms are occupied as offices, by jobbers, wholesale
merchants, and bankers.</p>
<p>Goods are sold in wholesale, usually at two or three installments of
31 days each, which are seldom liquidated in less than 6 or 8
months.</p>
<p>The trades are divided into different guilds, called <i lang=
"tr">esnafs</i>; each one governed by its own laws and officers. The
chiefs of these guilds are always Mussulmans, and appointed out of the
corps of superannuated palace attendants, such as boatmen, cooks, and
scullions, who are thus pensioned off. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have desires to which we are impelled by nature,
and their attainment is indispensable to the continuation of life; but
we have desires also which are the results of acquired tastes, and
which habit often makes as impulsive as our natural wants. Thus are
created the luxuries of life, and to increase the delight which we
derive from such sources of enjoyment, we endeavor to refine, to
etherealize their forms, and to divest them of all sensual and grosser
accompaniments.</p>
<p>Among such luxuries, coffee and tobacco are pre-eminent, which are
made even the basis of hospitality and the bond of social intercourse
by all the Osmanlis. Tobacco, when imbibed in its exquisite forms, is
the source of the most refined enjoyments, creating those reveries and
dreamy sensations which float for the moment about our listless senses,
beclouding with a silvery vapor some of life&rsquo;s dull realities.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span></p>
<p>Tobacco, ever since its first introduction to the civilized world,
has become so indispensable an item of consumption that it has long
been ranked among the staple commodities of life, and seems to claim
the double title of a natural and artificial taste. Yet, no form of
pleasure and exhilaration has ever been the subject of so much study,
as the ways and means of enjoying this fragrant weed.</p>
<p>All the world are well aware of the different forms in which tobacco
is used, viz., inhaling in the form of smoke, titillating the nostrils
by its powder called snuff, or imbibing the juice into the system by
the process of mastication. The two latter forms of enjoying this
luxury, seem to admit of no refinement, as time has rolled on, and
snuffing and chewing yet remain in their pristine state of
simplicity.</p>
<p>On the contrary, no ingenuity has been spared to invent, improve or
remodel the various vehicles by which the more exquisite and graceful
practice of smoking may be enjoyed.</p>
<p>Although tobacco may have been indigenous to America, yet we have
the assertion of Professor Beckman to corroborate the fact, that this
plant was known to the Tartars long before the discovery of America. As
early as the year 1610 a native Turk was paraded through the streets of
Constantinople with a pipe transfixed through his nose, as the penalty
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span>of indulging in the pastime of smoking, which
was then in great disrepute.</p>
<p>Indeed, if we may credit tradition, Mohammed himself predicted
&ldquo;that in times to come there should be men, bearing the name of
Mussulmans, but not really such, who should smoke a certain weed called
<i>D&uuml;khan</i>, or Tobacco.<span class="corr" id="xd25e4928" title=
"Not in source">&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Tobacco was introduced into England soon after the discovery of
Columbus, by Sir Walter Raleigh, and thence found its way into Europe;
but not until fifteen years after do we hear of it among the Turks,
whence it seems that the Orientals must have acquired their knowledge
of this plant through some other channel, most probably from their
Tartar neighbors. But from whatever clime we first derived this
fragrant weed, there is no doubt that the earliest method of using it
was in a <i>pipe</i>, and not in the form of cigars, or by imbibing the
juice by chewing&mdash;which latter practice was unknown to the early
lovers of tobacco, and is unpractised by the Orientals even at this
day.</p>
<p>As the aromatic plant by degrees became essential to the happiness
of mankind, even including the fair sex, doubtless the inconvenience of
the pipe suggested the idea of a more portable form, whence the
invention of cigars.</p>
<p>In Holland, in 1570, they smoked out of conical <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href="#pb302" name=
"pb302">302</a>]</span>tubes, made of palm-leaves plaited together; and
subsequently the leaf of the plant was rolled up, and the present form
of cigars adopted. The only recommendation to the form of cigars is
their convenience; but many amateurs pretend that they thus attain a
stronger relish of the tobacco than from pipes. The cigar is certainly
strong in its fumes, but whether the <i>relish</i> is greater is a
matter to be questioned, and in this form the injurious and even
poisonous properties of the plant are imparted to the system. Besides,
there is the close proximity of the fire to the mouth and teeth;
secondly, the condensation of the essential oil on the lips, leaving a
yellow tinge around the mouth; thirdly, the gradual dissolving of the
end of the cigar in the mouth, producing, by its nicotine property,
irritation of the gums and the salivary glands; fourthly, there is the
necessity of always holding the cigar, which in the course of time
imparts a dingy hue to the fingers; fifthly, the danger of injuring the
clothes and furniture by the constant falling of the ashes; sixthly,
the eyes suffer from their proximity to the heated fumes; and last, but
not least, there is the satisfaction of imbibing the nectar-juice of
some black mouth, for the black nymphs who are employed in this
manufacture, always salivate their handiwork, by way of giving it a
smooth and handsome finish. Surely, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb303" href="#pb303" name="pb303">303</a>]</span>could our amateurs
but witness the manufacture of their favorite Havanas, they would
forever eschew that form of the aromatic weed.</p>
<p>But apart from all these considerations, the very <i>convenience</i>
of the cigar becomes an objection; for being always at hand, the too
frequent use of it has converted the pleasure into an evil&mdash;such a
constant craving being excited that even the health is injured.
Doubtless this perverted taste, in circumstances where smoking has not
been permitted, as on board ships, behind counters, in offices, etc.,
has induced the pernicious practice of chewing.</p>
<p>Those nations who retain the original, natural, and simplest mode of
enjoying the weed, have never relinquished the pipe, but have varied
the form of this implement, and much beautified and improved it. The
people who have retained the use of the pipe, are the Dutch, Irish,
English, Scotch, Germans, Russians, Turks, Persians, and all Orientals.
In the perfection of the art of smoking the Persians may rank first,
then the Osmanlis, Russians, Hungarians, Dutch, English, and last of
all the Germans.</p>
<p>The Persians rank high in this respect, because they have studied
the philosophy of enjoying the fumes of tobacco in their greatest
purity. This they have attained by passing the smoke through water, and
thus purifying it from the essential oil of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name=
"pb304">304</a>]</span>plant. The kaleon of the Persians, the hookah of
Hindostan, the shish&eacute; of the Arabs, or the narghill&eacute; of
the Turks, is an air-tight vessel partially filled with water, on the
top of which is a bowl to contain the ignited tobacco. From this bowl a
tube descends into the water, and the long and flexible pipe is
inserted into the vessel above the level of the water. When the smoker
begins to draw through the pipe, a partial vacuum is created in the
vessel, which occasions the pressure of the external air to force the
smoke of the tobacco downward through the small tube above mentioned
into the water beneath, where, after losing its solid particles, it
bubbles up into the vacant space above, and thence through the pipe to
the mouth of the smoker.</p>
<p>But ever since the peculiar and agreeable properties of this
fragrant plant have been known, the ingenuity of its votaries has been
excited to invent and improve the ways and means of obtaining the
greatest amount of satisfaction from its use.</p>
<p>In the earliest stages the pipe was made of one entire piece of
clay, but soon the fact was established that this substance became so
heated as to decompose the tobacco. Metallic and other pipes were
tried, but still the same evil existed; until wood became the most
popular material. But that being combustible, the flavor of the tobacco
was deteriorated; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href=
"#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span>at last the arrangement was made
of a stem of wood with a bowl of clay attached to it, to contain the
ignited plant. The wood was a nonconductor of heat, capable of being
constructed of any length, and moreover, easily cleaned, so that this
was pronounced the great desideratum.</p>
<p>The Turks have displayed the greatest refinement and taste in the
manufacture of their long and beautiful chibouks or pipe-stems, to
which they attach the amber mouth-piece, so agreeable to the lips and
free from all impurities.</p>
<p>A peculiar species of clay was discovered in Turkey so remarkably
argillaceous as to supersede all other substances for the construction
of pipe-bowls; and these Oriental and philosophic smokers have
displayed their wisdom and science in the peculiar form into which they
have molded them. The form of a <i lang="tr">l&uuml;ll&eacute;</i>, or
Turkish pipe-bowl, is that of an inverted cone, the base of which, when
filled with tobacco, forms the surface. The design of this form is to
present a greater surface of exposure to the atmosphere, and to bring a
smaller body of tobacco in contact with the bowl, which is made as thin
and delicate as the nature of the material will permit, so as to
possess the least quantity of body, and thus less power of retaining
heat. The pipe should be lighted in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb306" href="#pb306" name="pb306">306</a>]</span>centre of the bowl,
not with a piece of <i>paper</i>, which would scorch the surface of the
tobacco, but with a small piece of spunk. At each inhalation the
ignited circle enlarges and extends toward the edge of the bowl, and as
the combustion takes place <span class="corr" id="xd25e4977" title=
"Source: proportionably">proportionally</span> downward, it is evident
that all the tobacco is consumed without the assistance of
<i>fingering</i> it, as the Germans are in the habit of doing.</p>
<p>The stem is always of wood, but great care is used in its selection.
Jasmine is cultivated expressly for pipe-stems, and carefully trained
so as to increase in length and uniform thickness. Cherry-stems are
much prized and more durable than the jasmine, and there is a species
of wild fruit tree called germeshek, peculiar to Turkey, remarkably
suited for the use of tobacco, and very generally used. These
pipe-stems are never less than four or five feet long, and perfectly
straight. The object gained by the length is that the smoke arrives at
the lips comparatively cool, having deposited its more solid particles
in the stem, which being perfectly straight is easily cleansed; for it
is an essential point that the pipe should, contrary to German
philosophy, be kept pure. Still another advantage gained by the length
is that the pipe may be easily disposed of for the moment, resting by
the side or against a table without deranging the tobacco <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>in
the bowl, which should always have a small brass tray beneath it to
protect the floor from any accident.</p>
<p>Certainly, then, a Turkish chibouk is unequalled as an implement for
smoking. The pure amber mouthpiece often glittering with brilliants,
the long stem, one unbroken length of slender jasmine, and the delicate
and beautifully-gilded bowl, seem to constitute the very essence of
refinement in the luxury of smoking; and no wonder that the Osmanlis
recline for hours on their silken cushions, and puff and puff again
&ldquo;ambrosial gales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One reason of the luxury displayed in the Turkish pipe is, that the
chibouk is an indispensable appendage of hospitality, always presented
to the guests, and constantly changed and replaced by another, each
successive pipe exceeding its predecessor in beauty and value, until
the visit is terminated.</p>
<p>The chibouks and narghill&eacute;s are symbols of luxury and wealth
among the Osmanlis, as services of silver are appendages of elegant
life to the Europeans, and there is great ambition to excel each other
in the costliness of their appurtenances of smoking. Many of the pashas
and other men of wealth, possess chibouks to the value of $50,000,
ranging from $10 upwards.</p>
<p>Sultan Mahmoud was forced to issue an edict <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308" name=
"pb308">308</a>]</span>forbidding the hosts to present them to
visitors, and ordering that every one should provide his own chibouk.
Hence the appendage to all gentlemen of rank of a Chibouk-gy, who
always accompanies his master.</p>
<p>The narghill&eacute;s or hookahs are also very popular, and often of
exquisite workmanship; but pipes being more portable and handy, are
generally preferred. The effort necessary to draw the smoke from the
narghill&eacute; is, by some, considered as objectionable, but a little
practice soon habituates to its use, and certainly with this instrument
we have the smoke in its greatest purity.</p>
<p>But it is not only the utility and beauty of the long chibouk which
constitute the Osmanlis the best and most philosophical smokers. There
is no tobacco in the world so delicious as the Turkish; so varied in
its degrees of narcotic strength, or so carefully prepared, and a taste
once being acquired for this species of the plant, all other varieties
become intolerable. A growing taste for this tobacco has of late been
acquired in America, and the increasing demand for this article has
induced speculators to flood the market with spurious imitations or
adulterations both imported and of home manufacture. Even in Turkey the
greatest connoisseurs can, with difficulty, procure the best species;
there are so many varieties <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309" href=
"#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>offered for sale; the very worst
kind, of which so much is exported to America, being from Smyrna and
its immediate neighborhood. The tobacco most valued, and justly so, for
its pure and aromatic flavor, is only raised in a small district of
Thessaly, in European Turkey, and is called Yenij&eacute; tobacco, from
the name of the region where it is cultivated.</p>
<p>There has been concocted a peculiar kind or brand of the plant under
the title of <i>scafarlatti</i>, which seems to have gained great
celebrity in the United States as being the genuine Turkish article.
This appellation is as yet unknown in Turkey, and must have sprung from
the inventive brain of some one of the Barnum race, who would even
enlarge the Turkish vocabulary at the expense of the <i lang=
"la">lingua Italiana</i>.</p>
<p>Not to notice the Western nations, who, with their clay pipes, have
remained <i lang="la">in statu quo</i> in the art of smoking, the
Germans deserve some criticism: for they have made many attempts to
arrive at perfection.</p>
<p>The material of which the German pipe-bowls are made, poetically
called <i lang="de">meerschaum</i>, is ill adapted for the purpose, and
the forms of their stems and mouth-pieces imply entire ignorance of the
science of smoking.</p>
<p>The <span lang="de">meerschaum</span>, or froth of the sea, is a
native <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name=
"pb310">310</a>]</span>rock formation of Turkey, and is excavated about
two or three hundred miles from the sea of Marmora. Every particle is
exported to Vienna, and it is never used by the natives, because it is
a calcareous substance, and when in contact with fire undergoes a
process of combustion to a sufficient degree to decompose the tobacco.
This fact is well attested by the circumstance that a <span lang=
"de">meerschaum</span> pipe-bowl is greatly enhanced in value when by a
long and tedious process it has lost all its combustible properties,
and is thus rendered incapable of deteriorating the tobacco. But why
select a substance which requires so long an apprenticeship, when
nature furnishes one well suited for the purpose? and why esteem an
article for its power of absorption and then prize it the more for
having lost it by time and use? German philosophy only can explain!</p>
<p>Apart from the unfitness of <span lang="de">meerschaum</span> for
the bowl, the form in which it is modelled shows how little the nature
of tobacco is understood by those sturdy people; for the form of an
elongated cylinder only serves to surround the weed by a heavy body of
combustible material capable of containing an excessive degree of heat,
and thus decomposing the tobacco. But the main object of these amateurs
of the <i>mere-sham</i> seems to be to deteriorate the fume of the
narcotic plant as much as possible&mdash;for to cap <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb311" href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>the
climax of their absurdity, a metallic cover is nicely fitted to those
exquisite pipe-bowls, and thus the favorite <span lang=
"de">meerschaum</span> is converted into a perfect retort for the
manufacture of tobacco-gas!</p>
<p>Their stems are generally made of the most ordinary wood, short and
curving, and the mouth-piece of the minutest dimensions. The object in
having such small mouth-pieces is to imitate the process by which
infants are nourished, by introducing them into the mouth and regularly
sucking up the smoke instead of inhaling it, as the Osmanlis do, by
merely resting their lips upon the large and oval surface of the amber.
The introduction of the piece into the mouth immediately excites the
saliva, which in part passes into the pipe, and is otherwise discharged
by spitting&mdash;a most disgusting practice unknown among the
Orientals. Notwithstanding also the shortness of the pipe, owing to its
curved form and the diminutive mouthpiece, it is almost impossible to
keep it clean. But it seems to be a sort of German philosophy not only
to have their pipes in a most filthy state, but to delight in and value
them the more in proportion to their antiquity and impurity. Truly
there is no accounting for taste, nor is it any longer a matter of
wonder that pigs delight to wallow in the mire.</p>
<p>If, then, the nations of the East, the Persians and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span>Osmanlis, are behind the age in other matters of
civilization, they have surely attained the acme of refinement in this
delight.</p>
<p>Nature, too, has favored them in the peculiar quality of their
tobacco, and the very indolence of their habits has led them to
meditate more diligently on their favorite luxury. Hence the palm in
this matter is to be given to their musical gurgling narghill&eacute;,
purifying and cooling the fragrant fumes, and to the long and graceful
chibouk, which a little care will keep always pure and ready for use.
These are well worth the adaptation of other nations. Some have,
however, objected to the chibouk as not being portable and convenient
during a promenade, as if there were a municipal law requiring all good
citizens to smoke in the streets. If the good taste of the community
should render the use of these chibouks and narghill&eacute;s popular,
there is no doubt that all the places for public refreshment would be
provided with them, as they now are in Turkey and all over the
East.</p>
<p>The coffee plant is well known to be a native of Arabia; it was used
as a drink in that part of the world as early as the ninth century of
the Hegira, and was gradually introduced into the countries of the
Levant; it was many times declared unlawful by the followers of the
Koran, as being of the class of inebriating liquors so often condemned
by Mohammed; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href="#pb313" name=
"pb313">313</a>]</span>but the Eastern nations are so addicted to its
use, that they say, &ldquo;A cup of coffee and a pipe of tobacco are a
complete entertainment!&rdquo; It seems that this beverage was made
fashionable in Paris about the year 1668, by a Turkish ambassador.
&ldquo;The elegance of the equipage recommended it to the eye, and
charmed the women; the brilliant porcelain cups in which it was poured,
the napkins fringed with gold, and the Turkish slaves on their knees,
presenting it to the ladies seated on the ground on cushions, turned
the heads of the Parisian dames. This elegant introduction made the
exotic beverage a subject of conversation; and in 1672, an Armenian at
Paris, at the fair time, opened a coffee house.&rdquo; This
establishment was much frequented by the literati, until the proprietor
added the sale of wine and beer to its attractions.</p>
<p>A similar attempt was made in New York in 1855, but soon
relinquished; notwithstanding the proverbial fondness of the Americans
for good coffee and tobacco. The fact is, their temperament is too
nervous, and their habits are too restless to allow them quietly to sip
their coffee and smoke their pipes as the Orientals do.</p>
<p>Besides, the style of preparing the coffee in Turkey is decidedly
superior to any known in Europe or America, and has met with the
approbation of those <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314"
name="pb314">314</a>]</span>who have tasted it either in New York, or
in the sultan&rsquo;s dominions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coffee is found on chemical analysis to contain a highly
nutritious element, known as caffein. This component part of all good
coffee is found to contain a larger proportion of nitrogen than any
other vegetable principle, and in this respect equals some of the most
highly animalized products, rendering it nutritious as a
drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The essential oil of the berry is so volatile, that the greatest
care and skill are requisite in its roasting and pulverization; for if
too much burnt, the aroma is destroyed, if underdone, the water fails
to absorb or extract the nutritious material, and if not properly
pulverized, a perfect chemical combination of the particles in solution
is not effected.</p>
<p>There is no doubt a desire among the Americans, to obtain this
beverage in its purity and excellence, as evince the many machines and
contrivances they use; yet they seldom if ever succeed in their
attempts.</p>
<p>The mixture from the grocers, and the ingredients they mingle at
home, such as eggs, isinglass, etc., render it impossible to secure a
pure, unadulterated, fragrant solution of this berry.</p>
<p>The commercial competition is so great that in order to be able to
undersell each other, all sorts of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315"
href="#pb315" name="pb315">315</a>]</span>cheaper substitutes are mixed
with the coffee, such as chicory, beans, peas, etc.; thus annihilating
the really nutritive properties of the genuine plant.</p>
<p>In a word, those who have never tasted a cup of good Turkish coffee,
are yet in unhappy ignorance of the peculiar aroma and deliciousness of
coffee as a beverage.</p>
<p>Coffee being the universal and favorite beverage in Turkey, the
first ideas of an Osmanli, upon opening his eyes in the morning, are
associated with his <i>kahv&eacute;</i> and <i>chibouk</i>, or coffee
and pipe, which in reality constitute his only breakfast, and are not
only used upon rising, but at all hours during the day, and at the very
moment of his retiring.</p>
<p>These luxuries are invariably offered to visitors, and their
omission is regarded as a breach of hospitality.</p>
<p>Their universal use has given rise to the establishment of numerous
kahv&eacute;s, which are the resort of persons of all ranks and
condition. They are to be met with in all parts and quarters of the
city, each having its own set of customers, and constituting, in
reality, the only casinos or club houses, where politics are discussed,
business transacted, and the news of the day freely circulated; in fact
the only Bourse or Exchange in Constantinople, was a coffee house at
Pershemb&eacute;-Pazar, in Galata: and it is only of late years that a
regular Exchange has been erected. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316"
href="#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span></p>
<p>Many of these kahv&eacute;s are very beautifully constructed, and
adorned with pillars and fountains, with gardens attached to them,
where visitors are entertained with sweet strains of music; and crowds
assemble to listen to the extravagant fictions of the <i>Meddahs</i>,
or professed story-tellers, or otherwise to wile away the time;
smoking, sipping the fragrant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317"
href="#pb317" name="pb317">317</a>]</span>berry, and playing
backgammon, <i>dama</i>, or <i>mangala</i>.</p>
<p>All games of chance are played by the Osmanlis, only for amusement,
and gambling is not generally practised by them.</p>
<p>The moral effect of these establishments upon the community is very
evident; for though wine is forbidden by the Koran, there are many
<i>mey-han&eacute;s</i>, or grog-shops, to be found in Turkey, which
are not generally frequented by people of any pretensions to
respectability; indeed drunkenness is a very uncommon vice, doubtless
owing to the numerous kahv&eacute;s, which afford the habitual
refreshments of pipes and coffee to the people, with every facility for
social intercourse.</p>
<p>On entering the coffee shop, there is an elevated platform on the
three sides, which is furnished with cushions or mats for the
accommodation of visitors. On the sides of the wall are various
grotesque pictures, and also shelves, where the implements of shaving
and toilette are so fantastically displayed as to create a somewhat
comic appearance, and one altogether peculiar to Turkey. At one of the
remotest corners is an elevated fire-place for the preparation of
coffee, which is served in very small cups. The diminutive quantity of
this beverage was so unsatisfactory to one of the sailors of the
English <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span>fleet at Constantinople, that upon tasting it he
observed, &ldquo;This is excellent; just bring me a dozen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surrounding the fire-place are shelves, upon which stand the
graceful narghill&eacute;s, with their brazen and polished mountings,
attractive and pleasing to the eye. But the most active and busy
personage in this <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319"
name="pb319">319</a>]</span>establishment is the <i>Berber</i>, or
barber, who is not only the shaver, hair-dresser, and trimmer in
general, but extends the province of his sharp profession to bleeding,
cupping, leeching, and tooth-drawing; the results of which avocations
are displayed at the door, fantastically strung and diversified with
colored beads.</p>
<p>Barbers always follow in the train of doctors, and even precede
them, for bleeding is a universal remedy in Turkey, whether the patient
is sick of fever or fright. Indeed, it is the custom for every body to
be bled once a year, generally in the spring, in order to purify the
system. Add to this the frequent application of leeches,
scarifications, and cupping, and it may be easily conceived that this
branch of industry is very profitable; still more so when it was the
custom to shave the whole head, for the convenience of frequent
ablutions. Many, in conformity with European civilization, now allow
the hair to grow, but those who oppose other reforms are equally
unyielding in this respect, and &ldquo;calculating even to a
hair.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb320" href="#pb320" name=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
<h2 class="main">HAMAM, OR BATH.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the East there is one source of comfort and
enjoyment which is more essential than all else, and that is the use of
the <i>bath</i>, which follows all other pleasures, when excess has
wearied the system, and precedes and prepares for anticipated luxuries
physical or mental. This process of purifying and refreshing the body,
is eagerly sought for as soon as the traveller arrives at
Constantinople; indeed seems to be second only in his mind to the
impressions of an entrance to the magnificent harbor.</p>
<p>The baths of classic memory, where the heroes of ancient Rome were
wont to prepare their sinews for the athletic games, and where the
patrician dames of Pompeii resorted, to add fresher and more glowing
tints to their fair charms, were all conducted on the same principle as
those of Stamboul at the present day.</p>
<p>It is wonderful that modern civilization should not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb321" href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>yet
have adopted the refinements of olden times, when they are so essential
to real health and comfort.</p>
<p>As by some mishap this desideratum exists, it would not be
mal-a-propos to describe the real charm and merit of these
institutions. The object of all bathing is to free the skin from the
deposits of insensible perspiration. This idea has been much in vogue
of late, as testify the water-cures, vapor-baths, medicated,
sulphurated, etc., being in reality rather vehicles for disease than
remedies. But the peculiar substance which closes up the pores of the
skin, cannot be removed by simple immersion in soap and water, for,
like all other greasy substances, it is composed of solid and liquid,
or stearine and olein, the liquid part of which may, in a chemical
combination, be absorbed by the water, but the skin will still remain
clogged up. Seeing the futility of the process of immersion, many have
supposed that a profuse perspiration excited by fumigation,
vaporization, etc., would carry off these deposits, by which processes,
however, the liquid portion only would be removed, and the system
reduced to a state of perfect exhaustion. The Turkish baths are neither
immersion nor vapor baths; but the atmosphere is heated by means of
flues through the walls, to a temperature suited to induce a free
perspiration, without causing over-exhaustion; for the interior is so
arranged that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=
"pb322">322</a>]</span>the bather, in passing from one apartment to
another, gradually becomes acclimated to the heat.</p>
<p>These baths, unlike many other institutions in the East, are
perfectly accessible to all, both natives and foreigners, and are the
more attractive on account of their entire dissimilarity from all
establishments for the same purpose in Europe or America.</p>
<p>Frequent ablutions, and the greatest personal cleanliness being
strictly enjoined upon all true believers, by the precepts of the
Koran, it is considered an act of piety to erect edifices and public
fountains for those purposes, either during life-time, or by personal
bequest; consequently, such instances of benevolence are by no means
rare, nor are the structures deficient in architectural beauty. They
are built of stone, and adorned with cupolas, besprinkled with globular
glasses, which transmit a softened light to the interior.</p>
<p>The interior is divided into three compartments; the saloon, the
tepidarium, and the bath itself.</p>
<p>The saloon, where the visitors dress and undress, is a large
apartment surrounded on three sides by elevated platforms, on which are
placed mattresses and cushions for the comfort and accommodation of
those who frequent the bath. In the centre of this room there is
usually a marble fountain, whose trickling waters soothe the ear, and
add beauty to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323"
name="pb323">323</a>]</span>scene, dispensing a delicious coolness to
the atmosphere. On his entrance to this saloon, the visitor is
immediately greeted with <i>Bouyourun</i>, (you are welcome), from the
attendants, who conduct him to one of the mattresses on the platform,
where he is undressed, within a temporary screen, made by holding up a
towel to prevent exposure of the person; for the Osmanlis are
sensitively modest, and feel a feminine delicacy in this respect, so
that none ever bathe in public without being suitably invested.</p>
<p>His watch, ring, and purse, are handed over to the Hamamgy for safe
keeping, and his apparel being carefully folded in a shawl, and
designated by his own head-gear, which is placed upon it, is deposited
by the side of the mattress, now appropriated to his exclusive use.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all these precautions, very ludicrous mistakes
sometimes occur, as happened recently to a certain soldier, who was
anxious to abandon the ranks, and possessing no other means of changing
his uniform for a citizen&rsquo;s dress, entered the bath <i lang=
"fr">en militaire</i>; where, after having performed his ablutions, he
committed the very slight error of appropriating to himself a
neighbor&rsquo;s mattress, with its accompanying wardrobe, and thus was
enabled to make an honorable retreat <i lang="fr">en bourgeois</i>.</p>
<p>Being now undressed, enveloped in large towels, and mounted on
<i>nalluns</i>, or wooden pattens, to protect his feet from the hot
marble and the water, the bather is conducted into the <i>Halvet</i>,
or tepidarium, which is heated to a degree a little above temperate,
where he reposes on cushions until he is gradually acclimated to the
atmosphere.</p>
<p>When the pores of the skin are opened, and perspiration excited, the
visitor proceeds to the inner room to go through the process of
bathing.</p>
<p>The <i>Hamam</i>, or bath itself, whose temperature is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb325" href="#pb325" name=
"pb325">325</a>]</span>raised to any requisite degree by means of flues
constructed within, and all along the walls, so as to allow the flames
to circulate freely in every direction, is in many of these
establishments, exceedingly beautiful; the dome being supported on
magnificent columns, and the walls and doors inlaid with large slabs of
marble, and adorned with finely chiselled fonts on all sides, which are
furnished with double ornamented brass cocks, for the supply of warm
and cold water.</p>
<p>There is an elevated marble platform in the middle, where the
bathers lie at full length, for the purpose of having their sinews
relaxed, and joints examined. Both the apartment, and this process in
particular, have been most ridiculously described, and, either through
malice or ignorance, most egregiously exaggerated by travellers; for
example, the public are informed that, &ldquo;A dense vapor sometimes
so fills the saloon, that he (the bather), sees nothing distinctly, but
figures flit before him like visions in a mist. Having walked, or sat
in this heated mist, till a profuse perspiration bursts out, the
<i>tellak</i> again approaches, and commences his operations. He lays
the bather on his back or face, and pins him to the ground by kneeling
heavily on him, and having thus secured him, he handles him in the
rudest and most painful manner. He twists and turns the limbs, so as to
seem to dislocate every joint. The sufferer feels as if the very spine
was separated, and the vertebr&aelig; of the back torn asunder. It is
in vain he complains of this treatment, screams out in anguish and
apprehension, and struggles to extricate himself. The incubus sits
grinning upon him, and torturing him, till he becomes passive from very
exhaustion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the first place, there is no dense vapor in a Turkish bath, but
the heat is produced by the flues in the walls; true, there is
sometimes the appearance <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href=
"#pb327" name="pb327">327</a>]</span>of mist, which is only created
momentarily by the quantity of hot water poured over the bathers, and
is soon dispersed by ventilation, for such an atmosphere is never
tolerated by the natives.</p>
<p>Now, as to the bather <i>being pinned to the ground in the rudest
and most painful manner</i>, <i>etc.</i>, there is more of a spirit of
ridicule than simple truth in this description; it being only resorted
to in cases of rheumatism, and the like maladies, when the patient is
extended on the marble platform, and all his joints examined and rubbed
by the <i>tellak</i>, or assistant, who, owing to the relaxed condition
of the nervous system, easily discovers the seat of any local pain, and
proceeds to dispel it by friction.</p>
<p>Many having experienced decided relief from this mode of treatment,
it is very frequently resorted to in Turkey. No such treatment,
therefore, ever occurs on ordinary occasions, unless the farce is got
up by special request, and for the benefit of strangers or travellers,
who, not content with the usual <i>modus operandi</i>, insist upon the
realization of their own extravagant ideas.</p>
<p>A native of Constantinople had to stop at Smyrna on his way to
America. Being anxious to enjoy the luxury of a bath once more, he
repaired to one of the establishments. As he wore a hat, the attendants
mistook him for a regular Frank or European, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb328" href="#pb328" name="pb328">328</a>]</span>and
he resolved to maintain the joke by pretending utter ignorance of all
the languages of the country. After having experienced many
absurdities, all novel to a native, he was at last stretched full
length upon his stomach on the marble platform of the bath. The
<i>tellak</i> kneeling by his side commenced a regular process of
pommelling him, and, at the same time, of cracking his joints. The
<i>incubus</i>, as though not satisfied with his own exertions, now
called for assistance from another tellak, who came and placed himself
on the opposite side, when both commenced in the rudest manner to push
their victim from one to the other. The sufferer, astonished at this
extraordinary treatment, was ready to split his sides with laughter,
which one of the tellaks taking as an indication of uneasiness,
observed to the other not to be so rude in his manipulations. He was,
in return, assured &ldquo;this is the way the Franks like, the harder
the better; also, they must not be allowed to think they haven&rsquo;t
had their money&rsquo;s worth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Doubtless an Osmanli would not only be much amused, but astonished,
could he behold the victim of a European vapor bath, as he sits boxed
up, and enveloped in blankets to his throat, parboiled with steam, and
suffocated by the fumes of brimstone; surely he would believe he had by
mistake got into the regions of Eblis. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb329" href="#pb329" name="pb329">329</a>]</span></p>
<p>When the person is in a state of free perspiration, he is seated by
the side of one of the fountains, beneath which are marble basins to
receive the water, both hot and cold, as it flows from the ornamented
cocks, for no Osmanli ever uses the tub, water which has once been in
contact with the body, having imbibed its impurities, is deemed unfit
for further use; therefore, on all occasions, their ablutions are
performed with flowing water, for they do not delight to wallow and
splash in a solution of their own dirt.</p>
<p>The tellak having upon his right hand a <i>kesse</i>, or bag made of
raw silk, commences a <i>gentle rubbing</i> (for they cannot bear any
rude or rough treatment, for which reason the delicate hands of boys
are employed), over the surface of the body, by which the deposits of
insensible perspiration are disengaged from the pores of the skin, and
combining together fall from the person like fibres of paste, which, to
the uninitiated, might seem like the peeling off of the outer pellicle
itself.</p>
<p>In this process consists the real virtue of a Hamam, and to it alone
is to be attributed the peculiar velvet-like softness of the skin of an
Oriental, which even gives them an air of effeminacy.</p>
<p>Immediately after the process of shampooing or rubbing, the marble
font having been filled with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href=
"#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>water of the desired temperature,
it is poured over the person of the bather from the brass <i>tass</i>,
or bowl, used for the purpose by the attendant. The person is now
thoroughly washed with perfumed soap, again water is poured over him in
abundance, and he is finally enveloped in the <i>havlous</i>, or large
napped towels, manufactured in the country expressly for the purpose,
and admirably adapted to absorb moisture.</p>
<p>Now perfectly purified, with a sensation of languor, the bather
proceeds to the dressing saloon, where, as he reclines upon luxurious
cushions, his whole being seems momentarily lost in that dreamy repose
of half-conscious existence, which is the true <i>kief</i> of an
Oriental.</p>
<p>He is only awakened to real life by the assiduities of his
attendants, some gently fanning him, and others presenting sherbet,
coffee, pipes, etc.</p>
<p>The fatigue and languor gradually pass away, as, with a sensation of
renovated existence, he reposes until the heat of his body is reduced
to its natural temperature. His toilette being completed, he surveys
himself in a small enamelled mirror which is offered to him, and after
depositing upon it the amount of money compatible with his own station
in life, he quits the precincts of this luxurious establishment, light,
joyful, and contented. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href=
"#pb331" name="pb331">331</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Hamams being altogether charitable institutions, there is no
fixed price demanded from visitors, for the use of the bath
itself&mdash;it being entirely left to their own option. But the
personal services of the attendants, and the wear and tear of the
splendid bathing paraphernalia not being included in the same category,
an adequate remuneration is of course expected. This also is left to
individual generosity; in ordinary cases, from half to three quarters
of a dollar is sufficient, but there may be no limit to a
person&rsquo;s munificence, nor to the attentions bestowed upon
him.</p>
<p>A gentleman of rank once visited a bath where he was an entire
stranger, and although he was not treated with even ordinary
politeness, he left on his departure a sum of money far beyond the
expectations of the attendants, which, opening their eyes, forced them
to make a thousand apologies for their remissness, and protestations
for the future. The gentleman soon after gave them an opportunity to
retrieve their former errors, and contrary to their excited hopes
rewarded them with a couple of piasters (about 8 cents) observing,
&ldquo;This is what you merited on my first visit, and what you then
received is the equivalent for your present services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The money collected at the bath is divided into two portions; one of
which is for the Hamamgy, or <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href=
"#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span>proprietor, and the other is
shared among the attendants.</p>
<p>Many of the public bathing houses are divided into two parts, one
for men, and the other for women, and when the establishment is not a
double one, Fridays and Sundays only are reserved for men, and the rest
of the week allotted to the ladies.</p>
<p>There are always exquisite specimens of these Hamams attached to the
houses of the wealthy; and their friends and neighbors are often
invited to partake with them of this amusement.</p>
<p>As the Osmanli ladies very seldom enjoy the excitement and bustle of
a crowd, they consider the occasion of <i>going to bathe</i> as one of
the greatest festivity; and they always carry with them every article
necessary for comfort or luxury, the Hamamgy not furnishing mattresses,
towels, etc., as in the case of the gentlemen.</p>
<p>Besides the opportunity of displaying embroidered cushions, napkins,
etc., they find rare and ample amusement in the discussion of scandal,
moral and political, as well as general domestic gossip.</p>
<p>The <i lang="fr">tout ensemble</i> of a lady&rsquo;s bath is one
altogether peculiar, and of course more enchanting to the eye than the
ablutions of their lords and masters.</p>
<p>The following description of a visit to a bath by a lady long a
resident in Constantinople, may be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333"
href="#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span>interesting as the result of
personal observation and experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My first Turkish bath&mdash;shall I describe it,
dear?&mdash;We were a large party. The mother, her three daughters,
three maids, and my humble self. You would have supposed we were
arranging our wardrobes for a long season of travel&mdash;except that
the garments would be rather unpresentable on ordinary occasions. Very
peculiar nappy towels, large as sheets, issued forth from their repose
in the vast closets, white and colored, embroidered and fringed;
head-gear of the same style; curious-looking yellow woollen mittens, to
rub with, they told me; innumerable shining bowls; tremendous
stilt-like clogs for the feet, great bars of soap, precious packages of
dyes, paints, capillary antidotes, perfumes, essences, mirrors in
embroidered frames, and a thousand other etceteras of Oriental
toilette, in due order entered the vast bundles which were in
preparation. Next appeared a beautiful rug or carpet, a rich silken
mattress and cushions, and a large piece of crimson woollen, shaggy
material, to envelope the cushions, such as I have frequently seen
spread in the beautiful cayiks. Really one would have supposed we were
to be deposited in some unfurnished dwelling with all this
paraphernalia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then came the private wardrobe of each individual
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span>neatly folded in a separate envelope&mdash;and
last but not least; the most refreshing array of fruit, sherbets, and a
curious machine, some five stories high, in whose different
compartments were packed various specimens of Turkish cookery. I began
to wonder if we were ever to return from this bathing pic-nic, so vast
were the preparations; but every one was gay, and nothing was tiresome.
Besides we always go to bathe in this style, at least once a month.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our carriage waited at the door, a grand spacious one,
covered with crimson shag, the ends trimmed with deep fringes of
gold&mdash;no seats, but plenty of cushions, and two milk-white oxen
were our steeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having duly veiled ourselves, that our
&lsquo;ornaments&rsquo; or charms might not be displayed to the eyes of
the unprivileged, we ascended the steps at the end of our araba, and
were seated according to our respective ranks. The old lady and myself
occupying the honorable places in the front, just behind the tails of
the oxen, which were fortunately looped up, so that they could neither
switch us, nor themselves. There is a decided advantage in this seat,
the view being unobstructed by any coachman, as that dignitary always
walks before the head of the animals. Next to us were the three Hanums,
behind whom were the maids and bundles, and the large pannier was slung
underneath full of its creature comforts. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb335" href="#pb335" name="pb335">335</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt as if I had suddenly been transformed into a houri, as
they all declared that the <i>Yashmak</i> converted me into a real
Circassian beauty. In due time we arrived, and descended from our airy
vehicle. As we entered the outer hall of the bath, each one made a
polite <i>temennah</i> to the <i>Hamamgy-Kadun</i>, or the lady
proprietress, who was squatting on her cushions in a corner. This
salutation she returned, to all genuine Turkish ladies (myself
included) with the same polite gesture&mdash;but the unfortunate
giavours only received a slight nod, no matter how profound their
selams. It is well to be queen somewhere, even of a bathing
establishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The maids, Eleny, Maria, and Sophy, spread out our cushions
in one of the niches upon the elevated platform, and as they modestly
held up a towel as a screen, we proceeded to reduce ourselves to a
state of nature. Enveloped from head to feet in our bathing
habiliments, which hung about us in just such folds as they drape the
statues&mdash;we willingly thrust our pedestrial extremities into the
great clogs, inlaid with mother of pearl, entered the antechamber of
the bath, and sat down on the marble platform to acclimate ourselves.
Here we take a <i lang="fr">coup d&rsquo;&oelig;il</i> of the strange
scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old women without any charms to conceal, spare themselves the
effort, and multitudes of naked cherubs <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb336" href="#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span>patter about. Yonder
sits a victim to paints and dyes&mdash;her hair now white, suddenly
becomes beautifully black, and the colour streaming over her body
bedecks her for the moment <i lang="fr">&agrave; l&rsquo;Indienne</i>.
But that was all washed off, and they proceeded to rub a sort of mud
all over her body, to take out the pains. Then she underwent a process
of pommelling, as she was stretched out on the marble floor&mdash;poor
thing, she had both rheumatism and grey hairs, and was a fit subject
for the most special and extra efforts of the attendants of the bath.
But the children! such victims, of all ages, from one month upwards,
were screaming to the highest pitch of their little voices, as they
were unmercifully rubbed and lathered from the crown of their heads to
the soles of their feet. &lsquo;Rough up and smooth down,<span class=
"corr" id="xd25e5346" title="Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span> seemed to
be no part of the nursery creed of their unmerciful mothers, but rough
all ways. Amid these infantile yells and agonies, the girls, young and
pretty, walked up and down, pattering with their clogs, and chanting
their wild native melodies, as if to put out all other noises, and the
great marble halls did their best to re-echo all these floating
sounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was I in Paradise or Pandemonium; were these peris or demons,
I could not tell; everything was so bewildering. I was duly rubbed, and
washed like the rest&mdash;then it was proposed to take lunch. Our
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href="#pb337" name=
"pb337">337</a>]</span>party <i lang="fr">en d&eacute;shabill&eacute;
de-pechetemal</i>, which means, crimson faces and napkin drapery, with
long and dripping hair, sea nymphs&mdash;maids of the mist&mdash;seated
themselves on the marble platform in the cooler room, and the large
round tray made its appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How delicious the iced sherbet, the little balls of rice
covered with delicate vine leaves&mdash;the artichokes <i lang=
"fr">&agrave; l&rsquo;huile d&rsquo;olive</i>, the kebab, the
helva&mdash;in a word, spite of the strange table, strange costume, and
general humidity, we all had tremendous appetites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, came a chibouk to the old lady, little cigarettes to
the young maidens&mdash;a delicious cup of coffee, and we all raised
our voices in a sweet Turkish song, about loves, jessamines, g&uuml;le
and b&uuml;lb&uuml;ls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being thus recruited, we were able to undergo the last
ablutions, and with a complete investment of pure white and delicately
perfumed towels, we proceeded to our first niche in the great
dressing-room, and laid us down to dream, or listlessly to watch the
innumerable toilettes of the devotees to <i>Venus</i> and Love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some, all fair and rosy, were reclining luxuriously like
ourselves, enveloped in fine white drapery, richly embroidered and
fringed with gold, while their beautiful slaves, whose charming figures
were not so carefully concealed, were combing, braiding, and perfuming
the long silken tresses of the fair hanums. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name="pb338">338</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;After we had amused ourselves at the indifference of the
really beautiful, and the minute and strenuous efforts of others to
appear so, we again sipped our coffee and completed our toilette, ready
at any time, to spend another day in such delightful aquatic luxuries.
I could not help contrasting my sensations with those I had often felt
on leaving one of the bathing establishments in my own country.
<i>There</i>, a solitary closet, a tub, from which perhaps some dirty
wench had just emerged, a hook or two, a dirty flesh brush for general
service, etc. True, the warm water was agreeable, and for the moment
caused an oblivion of all antecedents, the hook convenient, and the
brush need not be used. After an immersion of perhaps half an hour, you
hurry on your apparel, and hurry home, all <i lang="fr">&agrave;
l&rsquo;Am&eacute;ricaine</i>. But here, in this Turkish bath, how
imperceptibly a whole day had passed away, how entertaining the scene,
how beautiful the fair handmaidens of Nature, so soft and pure, after
their watery festivities. Their skin so white, their lips so red, the
delicate rosy tinge of their cheeks so tempting; even old age seemed to
bloom again, while a universal exhilaration took possession of us all.
A delicate tissue of softness seemed to envelop my body, and a
wonderful feeling of amiability and love for all the race of human kind
glowed within my breast. Every motion gave <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name="pb339">339</a>]</span>me
pleasure, and I could scarce recognize myself. Alas! for American
ladies, they can never feel the true <span class="corr" id="xd25e5381"
title="Source: oriential">oriental</span> <i>Kief</i> in bathing; for
they have no cushions to repose upon, no softly murmuring fountains to
lull their senses, nor any such relaxation from all external and
internal woes, as follows a Turkish bath. In vain they tinge their
complexions, powder, and wash, they cannot attain this <span class=
"trans" title="to kalon"><span class="Greek" lang="grc">&tau;&#8057;
&kappa;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;</span></span> of beauty, nor be
electrified by this wand of enchantment, which renders the humblest
Cinderella of the Orient lovely as a princess, and says avaunt to all
the modern mysteries of the toilette.<span class="corr" id="xd25e5396"

<h2 class="main">THE RAYAS OR NON-MUSSULMAN SUBJECTS.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE ARMENIANS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The whole population of Turkey may be estimated at
over 35,000,000 of souls, including the principalities and other
tributary states, which, if deducted, leaves 27,000,000 in Turkey
proper, half of whom are Mohammedans, and the rest Christians and
Jews.</p>
<p>The Christians are of various denominations, each denomination
constituting a separate community, governed by their own municipal
regulations, and guided by their respective spiritual heads.</p>
<p>Hitherto the Europeans have regarded the Greeks as the predominating
Christian population of the East; the truth is, among the different
communities the Armenians stand most prominent, because not only next
to the Bulgarians they rank high in numbers, but in reality supersede
all others, politically and morally, in their relations with
Turkey.</p>
<p>Although the Bosnians, Bulgarians, and the Greeks profess the same
religion, they do not surrender their <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb341" href="#pb341" name="pb341">341</a>]</span>respective
nationalities. The Greeks themselves are not, therefore, so numerous as
is generally supposed, but have erroneously been confounded with the
others.</p>
<p>The Armenians, of whom there are 3,500,000 in Turkey, like other
nations, have evinced their pride in national pedigree, by tracing
their origin to Haig, the grandson of Noah, and they call themselves
Haiks even at the present day.</p>
<p>In the year of the creation of the world, 1757, Jewish chronology,
soon after the flood, and even during the lifetime of Noah, Haig, or
Haicus, with his sons and daughters, resided in the country of Senaar,
in Mesapotamia.</p>
<p>While they lived in those regions, the famous Tower of Babel was
erected, and the Babylonian Empire was founded by Belus.</p>
<p>Haig, unwilling to submit to the authority of Belus, returned with
his family, of about 300 persons, to the country of Ararat, where he
incorporated himself with the earliest settlers in those regions, who
had never wandered thence, and retained all the undisciplined habits
and freedom of their utter seclusion from the progress of
civilization.</p>
<p>It is more than probable that he and his descendants continued to
speak the language of their father Noah, and in that case there is no
more ancient tongue than the Armenian. Besides, while the descendants
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>of Shem and Ham emigrated to other lands, those
of Japhet who begat Gomer who begat Togarmah, the father of Haig
remained in the vicinity of Ararat, and there is no reason to suppose
ever changed their language. The Biblical history records the confusion
of languages of those who were in the land of Shinar.</p>
<p>The Armenians are as ancient as the Jews, and have ever remained as
separate a people; and even amid all their vicissitudes have preserved
their nationality with equal tenacity.</p>
<p>But Haig was not left long in quiet, for Belus, fearing that he
would become too powerful a rival, marched against him with his
warriors all clad in iron armour. Yet destiny was about to found a
great nation, and the small band of Haig proved victorious&mdash;an
arrow from the bow of Haig, transfixed the proud Belus as he was
retiring. Thus was the first impetus given to this embryo empire.</p>
<p>Victory and the spoils of war inflamed their breasts and
strengthened their resources; cities were erected, one on the very spot
of this battle.</p>
<p>Haig was a man of noble appearance, and superior intellect, which
must have had a perfect development during his long life of five
hundred years.</p>
<p>His immediate descendants built fortified towns, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=
"pb343">343</a>]</span>adorned with palaces, and caravanserais. A very
beautiful city was built by Semiramis, the queen of Babylon, which
occupied 12,000 workmen and 600 architects. She was enamored of Arah,
the Armenian king, who was surnamed the Handsome, and being a widow
wished to marry him. But he, disgusted at her demonstrations of
excessive fondness, refused the alliance. The consequence was, that she
determined to take him by force, and marched with her troops into his
dominions.</p>
<p>But all she obtained was the dead body of the beautiful young
Armenian prince, which she endeavored to restore to life by magical
incantations.</p>
<p>The beauty of the country and her own romantic associations,
inspired her with the desire to erect a monument of her magnificence,
and she founded the city of Shamiram, now called Bitlis, on the borders
of Lake Van, which became ever after her summer residence.</p>
<p>The Armenians enjoyed a long period of prosperity, waging successful
wars with the Syrians, Medes, Persians, and other neighboring nations,
until they were at last conquered by Alexander the Great, and remained
tributary to him for 176 years, under governors appointed by him and by
his successors the Seleucid&aelig;.</p>
<p>They now changed masters, and enjoyed great <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span>prosperity under the Arsacid&aelig; or Parthians
who freed them from the Seleucian yoke.</p>
<p>Their prosperity lasted for 580 years, until internal dissensions
rendered them easy victims to the intrigues of the Greeks and Persians,
who eventually divided this beautiful domain between them. Oppression
of all sorts, spiritual and temporal, now pervaded the once peaceful
and happy homes of this fated race.</p>
<p>Royal blood could not quench the fire of its rage, profusely shed by
the princes, in defence of their people and religion. Idolatry was
enshrined upon the altars, and the priesthood sacrificed to fire and
tortured upon the rack.</p>
<p>A temporary relief was afforded to the country by the rise of the
Bagratian princes, who were the descendants of Abraham, and who first
came into Armenia during the captivity of the Jews under
Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
<p>Bagarat, the founder of this Jewish line of princes, was
distinguished in the reign of <span class="corr" id="xd25e5462" title=
"Source: Valarsaces">Valarsace</span>, and was appointed by him to the
hereditary office of placing the crown upon the king&rsquo;s head, and
all his descendants were known as the Bagratians. Now it happened that
Ashot, one of their number, so pleased the caliph in his administration
of the affairs of his own tribe, that in the year 859 A. D., he
appointed him <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name=
"pb345">345</a>]</span>governor of Armenia, and dispatched Aali-Ermeny,
an apostate Armenian, to invest him with magnificent robes of state.
Although the nation was again restored to comparative tranquillity
under this race of princes, yet internal disunion and foreign
oppression did not cease to harass the country, and the Greeks finally
destroyed the Bagratian monarchy. But Melik-Shah, of Persia, regained
his sway over Armenia, and the power of the Greeks was thenceforth
annihilated.</p>
<p>The Armenian princes of the line of Reuben now governed the country,
and it was during their reign that the Crusaders took Jerusalem; and
while they were besieging Antioch, Constantine, the second of these
Armenian princes, supplied the army with provisions. He was in return
made a marquis, and received the order of knighthood, besides many
valuable presents. This line of princes was extirpated by the
Egyptians, who poured an immense and devastating army into their
country, and after besieging Leo, the last king, for nine months, took
him and all his family to Cairo, with all the royal treasures.</p>
<p>They remained in prison seven years, because they refused to
renounce Christianity. By the intervention of king Juan, of Spain, they
were set at liberty, and received from him many valuable possessions,
such as houses and lands. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href=
"#pb346" name="pb346">346</a>]</span></p>
<p>King Leo even appealed to England and France to assist him in
regaining the throne of Armenia, but without any good success. He died
in Paris, A. D. 1393, and was buried in the convent of Celestine.</p>
<p>His wife Mary, who belonged to the family of Lewis Charles, king of
Hungary, died at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The Armenians next fell into the power of the Ottomans; with their
last king their glory perished.</p>
<p>The sunrise over Mount Ararat, the meridian brightness over the
fairest portion of Asia, and the last departing rays shed over the
regions of Silicia, are all merged into the dark pages of
history&mdash;where but few ever seek to read the tale.</p>
<p>The ancient religion of the Armenians was that of the Magi, but the
introduction of Christianity among them was coeval with Christ.</p>
<p>Abgar, one of their kings, having had occasion to send ambassadors
to the Roman general Marinus, in Syria, upon the return of his
messengers, was apprised of the wonderful and miraculous performances
of the Messiah.</p>
<p>Giving a ready credence to the report that this was indeed the Son
of God, a second embassy was sent to entreat the great healer of the
sick to visit the king Abgar, who was laboring under a distressing
malady.</p>
<p>The letter was as follows: &ldquo;I have heard that the Jews murmur
against you, and seek to destroy you. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb347" href="#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span>I have a small but
beautiful city, which I offer you to partake with me. It is sufficient
for us both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is said that the Saviour received this embassy with much
satisfaction, and dictated to the Apostle Thomas this remarkable
reply,&mdash;&ldquo;When I shall rise to my glory, I will send you one
of my disciples, who shall remove your pains, and give life to you and
those around you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the Ascension of Christ, according to his request, Thaddeus,
one of the seventy, was sent to Edessa, who, having instructed the king
in the true faith, baptized him and the citizens of that
metropolis.</p>
<p>The seeds of Christianity were thus early sown in Armenia, still but
little progress was made until the appearance of Gregory of Cesarea,
three centuries later, who created such a revival of this faith, that
he was called the Illuminator, and his followers, the Gregorians.</p>
<p>The Armenian resembles the Greek church in some respects. They are
both Episcopal in their government. Both acknowledge the Trinity, and
the Immaculacy of the Holy Virgin, and perform the ceremony of the
Lord&rsquo;s supper, or the mass, with even more pomp than the
Catholics. The Armenians believe the divine and human nature of Christ
to be so blended as to form but one; whereas the Greeks <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span>declare them to be entirely separate. Therefore
the former, in administering the Eucharist, use only wine, and
unleavened bread, and the latter mingle water with the wine, and use
leaven in the bread. The Armenians, in case of necessity, partake of
the holy sacrament in other Christian churches, whereas the Greeks
acknowledge no church ceremonies as canonical but their own; always
re-baptizing those who may wish to come under their spiritual
jurisdiction. Their manner of signing the cross even differs, the one
making it from left to right, and the other from right to left. They
celebrate the church festivals on different days, and find many other
occasions on which to disagree.</p>
<p>The Armenians are not, therefore, to be confounded with the Greeks,
nor with that sect called <i>Arminians</i>, or the followers of
Arminius, but as a distinct people, originally inhabiting the country
about Mount Ararat, and professing Christianity at an early period.</p>
<p>The reason why they are known to the Western nations as the
Armenians, and not by their proper name, Haiks, is, that when Aram, one
of their early kings, and the father of Ara the Handsome, succeeded to
the throne of Armenia, he, by his wisdom and policy, so greatly
extended his dominions, that the power and valor of the nation was
acknowledged <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb349" href="#pb349" name=
"pb349">349</a>]</span>from Mount Caucasus to Mount Tauris. This prince
first raised his people to any degree of renown, both by the exercise
of arms and the cultivation of the arts of peace; so that contemporary
nations, in making mention of the actions performed by his subjects,
called them the deeds of the Aramians, or the followers of Aram, a name
which has been corrupted into Armenians; the country which these people
originally inhabited was called by them Haikastan, or Hayasdan, and
those regions which were added to their territories by the conquest of
Prince Aram were called <i>Aramia</i>, or in contradistinction to each
other, the former were called the Greater, and the latter the Lesser
Hayasdan, which the Western nations transcribed as Armenia Major and
Minor.</p>
<p>It will be perceived that they were at one time a very powerful and
flourishing nation, and were the envy of all the neighboring tribes;
facts well authenticated even by Roman historians.</p>
<p>In the reign of Tigranes, many unfortunate princes, who had fallen
prisoners to the Armenian king, were obliged to stand in his presence
in an attitude of Oriental deference, with arms folded on their
breasts, in token of perfect submission. Four of these wretched
monarchs had also to attend him constantly in their regal robes, and
when he appeared in public <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb350" href=
"#pb350" name="pb350">350</a>]</span>on horseback, his royal captives
preceded him on foot.</p>
<p>Mithridates, the uncle to the king Tigranes, rendered himself no
less glorious. He extended his dominions even to the borders of
Scythia. His subjects and tributaries comprised twenty-two nations; and
it is related that this prince conversed with equal fluency in all the
languages spoken by those peoples. Even Hannibal, the great
Carthaginian general, found an asylum in Armenia.</p>
<p>In the time of their greatest prosperity, they amounted to
30,000,000 of souls, but constant wars, with their attendant train of
famine, disease, and death, have sadly diminished their numbers, and
reduced them to less than five millions.</p>
<p>The depopulated condition of their provinces, and the internal
dissension of their princes, favored the depredatory invasions of
various nations, Romans, Greeks, Persians, Saracens, and Scythians, or
Turks. These last finally crossing over the Caspian Mountains in
hordes, subjugated them, and took possession of their immense
territories, and have ever since held them in bondage.</p>
<p>The Armenians were the first Christians who were subjugated by the
Mussulmans, and as they were the earliest Christian subjects, they
became, in their mutual relations, the model or measure for all
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351" name=
"pb351">351</a>]</span>succeeding conquests; for the Turks, profiting
by their first experience, ever after practised accordingly.</p>
<p>The conquerors, imbued with a spirit of Islamism, added to their
barbarities a system of religious persecution. The cruelties which they
committed on the inhabitants were horrible in the extreme. Aged men and
women were often tied in pairs, and then together cut in halves.
Pregnant women were frequently ripped open, and their unborn babes
wantonly thrown into the air; infants sucking at the breast were torn
from the arms, and massacred before the eyes of their distracted
mothers, so that human blood flowed in torrents throughout the country,
and well may the Osmanlis of the present day regard the very name of
Turk opprobrious, as it reminds them of former barbarities.</p>
<p>At last these persecutions and cruelties ceased; for perceiving the
advantages which they might derive from this hardy and industrious
race, and finding them also strong and enthusiastic in their faith, the
persecutors moderated their religious ardor, and adopting a more
politic course, opened negotiations with the Armenians, and willingly
compromised by making them tributaries, with the payment of
<i>Kharadj</i>, or poll tax, as recommended by the Koran; and by kind
promises for the future, their servitude was rendered more tolerable.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352" name=
"pb352">352</a>]</span></p>
<p>Besides, with the design of ruling them through religions
prejudices, the Armenians were granted the privilege of being governed
by one of their own priesthood, to whom they gave the title of
<i>Patrik</i>, or Patriarch.</p>
<p>The people being now deprived of all civil rights, regarded this
Patriarch as the sole bond of national unity.</p>
<p>The Turks, on their part, finding it an easy policy to govern the
mass through one individual, allowed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb353" href="#pb353" name="pb353">353</a>]</span>great privileges to
this office, and the free exercise of the principles of their own
religion in its administration.</p>
<p>The power of the Patriarch was so unlimited, that he could even levy
taxes, punish any person with the bastinado, imprison, or send into
exile.</p>
<p>National enthusiasm and the politic tolerance of their conquerors,
in the course of time, led the Patriarchs into the abuse of their
privileges.</p>
<p>Cloaked though they were under the mantle of religion, their
despotism was not always exempt from impunity. For the people, long
accustomed to regard the church apart from temporal authorities, could
not brook such conduct in their high priest, and therefore there has
always been a strife between them and the priesthood.</p>
<p>The government has sometimes sustained the popular will, and at
others, the rights of the pontiff, as interest or policy required.</p>
<p>This community constitutes the very life of Turkey, for the Turks
long accustomed to rule rather than serve, have relinquished to them
all branches of industry. Hence the Armenians are the bankers,
merchants, mechanics, and traders of all sorts in Turkey.</p>
<p>Besides, there exists a congeniality of sentiment and community of
interest between them and the Mussulmans. For, being originally from
the same <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name=
"pb354">354</a>]</span>region, they were alike in their habits and
feelings; therefore, easily assimilating themselves to their
conquerors, they gained their confidence, and became and still are the
most influential of all the rayas. There is not a pasha, or a grandee,
who is not indebted to them, either pecuniarily, or for his promotion,
and the humblest peasant owes them the value of the very seed he sows;
so that without them the Osmanlis could not survive a single day.</p>
<p>This is a fact so well attested, that Russia, with the design of
undermining Turkey, always endeavored to gain over this part of the
population, and in 1828, when she took possession of Erzeroum, she
enticed the Armenians of that place to acts of violence and revenge
against the Turks, so that when the Russians retired, the Armenians
were obliged to emigrate with them.</p>
<p>Besides, in the demarcation of her boundaries with Turkey, she so
managed as to embody <i>Etchmiadzin</i>, the see of the high pontiff of
the Armenians, within her own territories, for the express purpose of
governing them through their spiritual head.</p>
<p>Even the correspondent of the <i>London Morning Post</i>, in
speaking of the corruptions of the country, in his ribaldry, termed the
Armenians the <i>cloaca</i> of Turkey, accusing them of being the means
through whom all the filth passed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355"
href="#pb355" name="pb355">355</a>]</span></p>
<p>Naturally endowed with a brave and warlike spirit; of noble and
intelligent appearance, and great athletic vigor, their services have
ever been invaluable to the country; it has only been their protracted
servitude which has reduced them to the timid and cautious temperament
that they now possess.</p>
<p>Some have even distinguished themselves as statesmen, patriots, and
faithful servants. Had it not been for the good advice and diplomacy of
Abro, or, as he is commonly known to Europe, of Boghos Bey, Mehmed Aali
could not have secured to his heirs the independence of Egypt.</p>
<p>Again, at the conclusion of the last war with Russia, when Sultan
Mahmoud was writhing under his inability to meet the peremptory demands
of his enemy, an Armenian came to his rescue.</p>
<p>Kazaz Artyn was a most noted personage of the Armenian nation.
Having risen from the lowest rank in life, he finally became the head
of the Royal Mint, and the friend and factotum of his majesty Sultan
Mahmoud, who never passed a day without seeing him.</p>
<p>He was so much beloved by his imperial master, that although he was
a giavour, his majesty visited him at his last hours. This
condescension was not only remarkable in the king, but more wonderful
in a Mussulman; for the Koran forbids all intimacy with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href="#pb356" name=
"pb356">356</a>]</span>Christians. &ldquo;O true believers, take not
the Jews or Christians <i>for your friends</i>; they are friends the
one to the other; but whoso among you taketh them for his friends, he
is surely one of them.&rdquo; This passage explains the antipathy of
the Mohammedans to all Christians, as well as to the institutions of
Christianity.</p>
<p>Sultan Mahmoud being of an imperious nature, waived such religious
considerations when impelled by gratitude, and no one of the ministry
dared to breathe a censure against the imperial will; for as sultan, he
was not only above the law, but the law <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb357" href="#pb357" name="pb357">357</a>]</span>itself. Besides,
every one knew the extent of Kazaz Artyn&rsquo;s services to his royal
master.</p>
<p>At the end of the last war, when the Russian indemnities were to be
paid, there was not a single piaster in the treasury.</p>
<p>The sultan, in despair, shut himself up, and forbade any one to
approach him; but, reckless of consequences, Kazaz Artyn rushed into
the royal presence, and anxiously begged to be informed the cause of
his majesty&rsquo;s grief. &ldquo;The Muscovite giavours are insisting
upon their indemnities, and I am told the treasury is empty.&rdquo;
Whereupon Kazaz Artyn assured his majesty that their demands should be
met, even on the very next day.</p>
<p>He accordingly summoned all the bankers, and collected the necessary
funds, which were transmitted to the Russian Embassy to their utter
astonishment, in the course of twenty-four hours. This money remained
at the Russian Embassy, out of which they were accustomed to pay the
salaries of the whole legation, etc. The bankers were afterwards repaid
in <i lang="tr">beshliks</i>, a species of spurious coin, which are now
being redeemed by the present sultan.</p>
<p>The cultivation of the arts and sciences were of an early origin
with the Armenians.</p>
<p>In the reign of <span class="corr" id="xd25e5623" title=
"Source: Valarsaces">Valarsace</span>, the Parthian, 150 B. C. the
archives of Nineveh were searched by Maribas, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name="pb358">358</a>]</span>and
made to contribute to the literature of the nation; and during
Arsaces&rsquo; reign, the city of Armavir was embellished with several
pieces of beautiful statuary, which were taken from the Greeks. Three,
in particular, those of Diana, Hercules, and Apollo, well executed,
brazen and gilt, were from the hands of the celebrated Cretan artists
Scyllis and Dip&aelig;nus.</p>
<p>Duin, Ani, Edessa, and several other cities, were noted for their
architectural beauties, and, considering that Armenia is coeval with
the Babylonian Empire, there is no reason to doubt, that researches
into its territories would be as interesting, as those of Mossoul.</p>
<p>The Armenians having no alphabet of their own, adopted the
characters of other nations, viz., the Syriac in religious writings,
the Greek in scientific works, and the Persian for statutes of law. But
at the commencement of the 5th century, a monk, Mesrop by name,
invented the present characters, which have been in use ever since.
They are neat in appearance, and capable of representing any articulate
sound; thirty nine in number, and styled by Lord Byron, a Waterloo of
an alphabet.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that they early possessed some literature of their
own, prior to the invention of their alphabet, for even the writings of
Eusebius <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name=
"pb359">359</a>]</span>were originally discovered in the archives of
the Armenians. Many very eminent works, generally in MSS. on
martyrology and the affairs of the church, are still extant, and it is
reported that the old monasteries in Armenia contain records of
history, which, if brought to light, would prove great additions to the
annals of very ancient times.</p>
<p>They boast of classic authors, to whom Lord Byron alludes in
eulogistic terms, and the works of Moses of Khoren, which have been
translated, are highly appreciated by the literati of Europe.</p>
<p>The Armenians of the present day are also many of them distinguished
for their acquisitions in both Armenian and Turkish literature; and so
great is their aptitude for acquiring languages, that they are often
well versed in the various dialects of Europe. Even the children are in
the daily habit of speaking three different languages, viz., Turkish,
Armenian, and Greek.</p>
<p>In their domestic relations, living in constant intercourse with the
Osmanlis, and the lapse of time throwing the veil of oblivion over
their past sufferings, all their habits of life and general ideas have
become assimilated to those of their masters, with those distinctions
only, which result from the tenets of their faith. Self-respect has
forced them to seclude their women from the public, and hence they have
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb360" href="#pb360" name=
"pb360">360</a>]</span>same domestic arrangements, style of dress,
etc., as those of the Osmanlis.</p>
<p>Their social institutions, like other Orientals, are very
patriarchal, every man being a monarch in his own family, and the
children are educated to observe the greatest deference and respect to
their parents. No son or daughter ever dreams of contracting a marriage
on their own responsibility, but the destined bride is selected by the
mother and her friends, and is thankfully accepted by the happy
son.</p>
<p>The betrothal having been arranged with all due ceremony, the
wedding takes place at the appointed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb361" href="#pb361" name="pb361">361</a>]</span>time. The marriage
ceremonies are celebrated both at the house of the bride and of the
bridegroom during three days.</p>
<p>The bride is conducted by the bridegroom and his friends to the
house of her intended husband, and the ceremony is performed on Sunday
at midnight.</p>
<p>The bride, muffled and tinselled, is conducted to a carpet in the
middle of the saloon, where she is placed opposite to the chosen
bridegroom. Their right hands are joined by the officiating priest, and
they are severally demanded whether they will &ldquo;love, cherish, and
honor each other.&rdquo; The man is also asked, as he stands opposite
to this mass of shawls and tinsel, &ldquo;will you take this girl,
whether she be lame, or deaf, or humped, or blind,&rdquo; to which he
responds with due resignation, &ldquo;even so I will take her.&rdquo; A
silken cord, twisted of two colors, is now tied round the head of each,
and after a long service, reading of prayers and chanting, the happy
pair are pronounced man and wife! The bride, over whose varying
emotions during the interesting ceremonies an impenetrable veil was
suspended, is now led by two attendants to a corner of the sofa, where
she is temporarily enthroned on a cushion.</p>
<p>The propitious moment has at last arrived, and the legalized husband
may ascertain for himself the measure of charms to which he is allied.
While the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name=
"pb362">362</a>]</span>agitated maiden sits, oppressed by shawls and
tinsel, and internal anxiety as to the effect she may produce upon her
future lord, he slowly approaches, pale and tottering&mdash;for he has
sworn to have her, blind or hump-backed. With such alternatives, even a
moderate share of good-looks, or the mere absence of actual deformity,
would almost constitute beauty.</p>
<p>The attendant bridemaids exultingly raise the veil, and the new
husband ventures to take one look of love and admiration, in return for
which he places a valuable ring on her finger, and slowly retreats to
muse upon his fate, which is not often so deplorable, for the Armenian
girls are generally pretty. At all events, he submits with the best
grace, for, unlike his Mohammedan compatriots, he has no retrieve or
door of escape, but must abide by his bargain &ldquo;till death us do
part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The veil is again dropped, and the bride left to her own
meditations.</p>
<p>She receives presents from all the guests, so that the tickets of
admission to an Armenian wedding are no trivial affairs to one&rsquo;s
pockets.</p>
<p>Three days after the ceremony, the newly married couple are at
length left to a better acquaintance, unmolested by veils or
spectators.</p>
<p>The Sunday following, the bridegroom proceeds to his
father-in-law&rsquo;s house, to acknowledge his gratitude <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363" name="pb363">363</a>]</span>for
the possession of such a charming treasure, etc., all which is
expressed by the ceremony of kissing the hands of the parents of the
maiden, and this Sunday is called, par excellence, the
&ldquo;<i>Kissing Sunday</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These are the real Armenians; but about a hundred and fifty years
ago there was a secession in favor of Catholicism. The Catholic
Armenians, of whom there are about fifteen thousand in the metropolis,
and seventy-five thousand throughout Turkey, although distinct from the
Roman Catholics, have assimilated themselves, in many respects, to
European habits; forgetting their nationality and language, and aping
customs and usages they do not even understand; so much so, that a very
amusing work has been written in Armeno-Turkish under the title of
Acaby, as a burlesque upon such inclinations. They are not, therefore,
to be confounded with the orthodox Armenians. <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE GREEKS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Greeks, who sent the trophies of their versatile
genius, their graceful architectural adornings, and exquisite paintings
to the temples at Rome, and over the western world, whose classic lore
is yet the theme and model of the learned, once gloried in the
possession of the proud Stamboul.</p>
<p>About a century after its foundation by Constantine, it is said to
have possessed &ldquo;a capital, a school of learning, a circus, two
theatres, eight public and one hundred and fifty-three private baths,
fifty-two porticoes, five granaries, eight aqueducts of water, four
spacious halls of justice, fourteen churches, fourteen palaces, and
four thousand and three hundred and eighty-eight houses, which, for
their size and beauty, deserved to be distinguished from the multitude
of plebeian habitations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magnificent temple <i>Ayia-Sophia</i>, dedicated to the Goddess
of Divine Wisdom, rose like a Ph&oelig;nix <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span>from
its ruins, under the liberal patronage of Justinian, and the assiduous
labors of ten thousand workmen during five years, eleven months, and
ten days.</p>
<p>This was the shrine of the Greek Faith, and those walls glittering
with golden mosaic and precious stones, re-echoed the <span class=
"trans" title="Kyrie ele&#275;son"><span class="Greek" lang=
"grc">&Kappa;&upsilon;&rho;&iota;&epsilon;
&epsilon;&lambda;&epsilon;&eta;&sigma;&omicron;&nu;</span></span> of
the adoring Christians. The magnificent altar of precious metals and
glittering gems witnessed the prostrations of patriarchs and their
acolyths&mdash;and the impenetrable veil was suspended before the Holy
of Holies.</p>
<p>The great city was the arena for the sports of the pleasure-loving
Greeks; sometimes in the race of wild beasts with each other, and again
in the more terrible contests of the gladiators.</p>
<p>The Bosphorus was alive with human freight, youths and maidens,
wooed by its blue and sparkling waves, delighted to dream of love as
they glided over the gently-heaving waters.</p>
<p>The shores were gay and gladsome, as the enamored throng tripped
through the mazes of their fantastic Romaica to the tinkling music. But
the Grecian prince is hurled from his throne, and the grave and sombre
Moslem sits there, the despot and bloody conqueror. The great temple,
which rivalled even that of Solomon, is suddenly divested of the
symbols of a Christian faith. Its mosaics of the saints which adorn the
walls are obliterated, its cherubim are <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb366" href="#pb366" name="pb366">366</a>]</span>torn down, its altar
demolished, and nothing left of all the gorgeous decorations. The bare,
unadorned niche&mdash;the mihrab or index to the temple of Mohammed, is
instituted, and &ldquo;Allah-il-Allah,&rdquo; is henceforth the cry of
the Faithful.</p>
<p>Yet, they say, the distant chant of the last officiating priest of
the Greek religion still lingers within the walls, from whence he will
issue when the edifice is restored to its original worship.</p>
<p>Sports are over&mdash;maidens and youths are coy of their charms,
for a change has come over the spirit of their dreams.</p>
<p>The liberty of woman is shackled, and the dominion of seclusion
established. Certain quarters of the city are assigned to the Greek
subjects&mdash;and externally their very dwellings assume the dusky
tints of bondage and ruin.</p>
<p>Truly their glory has departed, and their name as a nation is only
sustained by the shades of their ancient heroes, who even after their
last degenerate descendant has mouldered into dust, will continue to
flit around the civilized world, scattering the scintillations of early
genius amid earth&rsquo;s darkness. Yet, as it is their nature to
boast, they point into the past, and even one day hope to sit on the
throne of their ancestors <span class="trans" title=
"eis tin polin"><span class="Greek" lang="grc">&epsilon;&iota;&sigmaf;
&tau;&iota;&nu; &pi;&omicron;&lambda;&iota;&nu;</span></span> of
yore.</p>
<p>There are no less than a million and a half of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=
"pb367">367</a>]</span>Greeks in the Turkish dominions, of whom
150,000<a id="xd25e5739" name="xd25e5739"></a> live in the capital. At
the time of their conquest, the Turks allowed them the same municipal
immunities and privileges as they had done to the Armenians.</p>
<p>As the Greeks seemed to approximate more nearly to the western
nations in their habits, than any of the other rayahs, the Osmanlis
supposed them more fitted to act as intermediaries between themselves
and the European states; they therefore became the first interpreters
of the Divan. Many of their number have thus risen to wealth and
distinction, and after long services they even succeeded to the
government of the Danubian Principalities&mdash;yet the Osmanlis have
never felt the same sympathy and confidence towards them as for the
Armenians, who, though not so advanced in civilization, possess better
stamina of character, greater honesty, and more congeniality of
temperament. Many Greeks, even now, occupy places of trust, which are
confided to them rather from political motives than as marks of
peculiar confidence. The office of saraf or banker, which is equivalent
to <i lang="fr">homme de confiance</i>, has never been successfully
filled by them, though attempts have been made to do so; this post has
invariably been assigned to the Armenians.</p>
<p>It is customary with the Osmanli grandee, when <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>appointed to some high station in the provinces,
before their departure, to leave with their banker a certain number of
<i>blanks</i> to be filled by him whenever occasion should require
their use. And many even entrust their personal property to the sarafs
on their pilgrimage to Mecca, for safe keeping.</p>
<p>One of the principal dignitaries of the present day, who is reputed
for his irascible temper, was some years ago involved in a dilemma. One
of his attendants was found to be guilty of a <i>liaison</i> with a
slave in his harem. The circumstances were aggravating, and his pride
could not be satisfied, save by dire revenge; and the two, instead of
being married, according to the custom of the country, fell victims to
his fury. But after the commission of the rash act, he repented, and
began to fear the disgrace which would probably fall on himself.</p>
<p>In his perplexity he sent for his old Armenian saraf, and when
closeted with him, poured his sorrows into the bosom of his confidant,
relating to him the whole circumstance, weeping bitterly for his act,
and asking advice and consolation.</p>
<p>Now, no Osmanli has as yet evinced such confidence and sympathy
towards the Greeks.</p>
<p>Besides, the pride of the Mussulmans is not compromised in
associating with the Armenians, who are so much like their masters in
manners and language, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href=
"#pb369" name="pb369">369</a>]</span>that often it is impossible to
detect any difference<span class="corr" id="xd25e5766" title=
"Source: ,">.</span> On the contrary, although some of the Greeks have
distinguished themselves in Oriental literature, especially Yacobaky,
in his History of Russia, written in elegant Turkish, yet they have
never been able to speak the language of the country correctly.</p>
<p>The moment they open their mouths, out leaps the native accent. This
is equally true of the French and other languages, and even their own
beautiful Hellenic can scarce ever be heard in Stamboul, a miserable,
mongrel island dialect being the substitute.</p>
<p>The character of the Greeks of Constantinople is thus admirably
portrayed by the author of Anastasius, the best work extant on
Turkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The complexion of the modern Greek may receive a different
cast from different surrounding objects; the core still is the same as
in the days of Pericles. Credulity, versatility, and thirst of
distinction, from the earliest periods formed, still form, and ever
will continue to form, the basis of the Greek character; and the
dissimilarity in the external appearance of the nation arises, not from
any radical change in its temper and disposition, but only from the
incidental variation in the means through which the same propensities
are to be gratified. The ancient Greeks worshipped a hundred gods, the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href="#pb370" name=
"pb370">370</a>]</span>modern Greeks adore as many saints. The ancient
Greeks believed in oracles and prodigies, in incantations and spells;
the modern Greeks have faith in relics and miracles, in amulets and
divinations. The ancient Greeks brought rich offerings and gifts to the
shrines of their deities, for the purpose of obtaining success in war,
and pre-eminence in peace; the modern Greeks hang up dirty rags round
the sanctuaries of their saints, to shake off an ague, or propitiate a
mistress. The former were staunch patriots at home, and subtle
courtiers in Persia; the latter defy the Turks in Mayno, and fawn upon
them at the Fanar. Besides, was not every commonwealth of ancient
Greece as much a prey to cabals and factions as every community of
modern Greece? Does not every modern Greek preserve the same desire for
supremacy, the same readiness to undermine, by every means, fair or
foul, his competitors, which was displayed by his ancestors? Do not the
Turks of the present day resemble the Romans of past ages in their
respect for the ingenuity, and at the same time, in their contempt for
the character of their Greek subjects? And does the Greek of the Fanar
show the least inferiority to the Greek of the Pir&aelig;us in
quickness of perception, in fluency of tongue, and in fondness for
quibbles, for disputation, and for sophistry? Believe me, the very
difference between <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb371" href="#pb371"
name="pb371">371</a>]</span>the Greeks of time past and of the present
day arises only from their thorough resemblance, from that equal
pliability of temper and of faculties in both, which has ever made them
receive, with equal readiness, the impression of every mould, and the
impulse of every agent. When patriotism, public spirit, and
pre-eminence in arts, science, literature, and warfare were the road to
distinction, the Greeks shone the first of patriots, of heroes, of
painters, of poets, and of philosophers. Now that craft and subtlety,
adulation, and intrigue, are the only paths to greatness, these same
Greeks are&mdash;what you see them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the Armenians have borne the first impetus of Mussulman
fanaticism, and consequently suffered more than any other Christian
subjects, yet the Greeks excel them in their animosity towards their
conquerors.</p>
<p>This is owing to their excessive bigotry, and it is recorded that
even while the enemy was before the gates of Constantinople, they were
discussing the great question, whether the Holy Ghost proceeded from
the Father or the Son.</p>
<p>This disposition to cavil on religious points, has made them a ready
prey to the domineering priesthood who have completely swayed the
multitude. These priests being a mean and grovelling set, utterly
indifferent to the moral elevation of their people, are <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name="pb372">372</a>]</span>ever
ready to make traffic of the sins of those who are still more ignorant
than themselves; the consequence is, that lying, cheating, stealing,
and other immoralities to any extent, are very common among this
community, for a few piastres, or even paras, cancel the crime and lull
the conscience.</p>
<p>The whole community suffers from such a system, as business and
other necessities bring them into constant contact.</p>
<p>The servants are generally Greek, and there is no virtue in lock and
key in any house. You suddenly find your wardrobe emptied by
imperceptible degrees, and the jars of preserves gradually diminish, as
they are repeatedly licked and sleeked over again.</p>
<p>Divorces are easily obtained, or they are granted after the priest
has extorted the last para he can from the applicant.</p>
<p>The corruption of the masses through their spiritual leaders is
painfully evident. The most dire superstition rules every mind, and the
veriest knaves, and even prostitutes, follow their injurious callings
without compunction, if under the patronage of one of their saints.
<i>Christos kai Panayiaumo</i> is an expiatory charm, and the dingy
portrait of any saint in the calendar annihilates the bad effects of
every crime. The most abandoned class of women are generally Greeks;
and while they perform the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href=
"#pb373" name="pb373">373</a>]</span>obscene rites of Bacchus and
Venus, they watch with holy trembling the twinkling taper which burns
night and day before the anointed picture of their guardian angel. This
flame, like the Vestal fire, is never suffered to go out, if perchance,
<i lang="la">Dii avertite omen!</i></p>
<p>The Greek islands furnish a miserable set of men and women to the
population of Turkey, who come to gather spoils in the metropolis, and
then return to enjoy them at home. Robberies, and even assassinations
are committed by them, which, if they are detected, are either
protected by the Greek legation, or punished by a short imprisonment,
and then the miscreants are again let loose, hardened in crime, and
thirsting to revenge their temporary detention.</p>
<p>It is only within the last two years, that a famous bandit, in the
vicinity of Smyrna, has been captured. <i>Katurjy Yanny</i> and his
merry men had long infested the neighboring mountains, detaining
gentlemen on their travels, carrying them blindfolded to their den, and
only liberating them upon the receipt of a handsome ransom from their
friends. The eagle of the mountain was at last caged in the humble
prison of Smyrna. While other miserable victims were peeping through
their latticed and iron bound casements, whining out a feeble cry for
alms, he, the proud chieftain, sat upon a sofa, dressed in the
picturesque costume of the Greek mountaineer, his eyes flashing
defiance, and his lofty bearing all princely, as he puffed his
narghill&eacute;, and chatted with those about him. But he must now
feel somewhat crest-fallen, as day succeeds day, and he still dwells
within the awful precincts of the Bagnio, whence, like the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb375" href="#pb375" name="pb375">375</a>]</span>rest
of its miserable occupants, the once proud Katurgy Yanny, sometimes
emerges, broom in hand, and chained to his fellow, to sweep the streets
of the metropolis.</p>
<p>The restless temperament and fanaticism of the Greeks have ever made
them the most turbulent of the Ottoman subjects, and ready instruments
in the hands of Russian diplomatists for sowing the seeds of discord
and confusion in the Turkish empire. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Jews of Turkey, of whom there are about 170,000,
are by no means exempt from the sorrows and curses of their race. As if
conscious that there is no escape from the contempt of the rest of the
world, they are willing to undertake the meanest of earth&rsquo;s
callings, literally to &ldquo;eat the dirt&rdquo; of their Moslem
masters.</p>
<p>Content to appear like the refuse of humanity, they strive to
accumulate the miser&rsquo;s hoards, and receive the buffetings and
cursings of their neighbors as if they were choice
blessings&mdash;usury of all sorts, whether upon sequins or old
clothes, peddling the meanest of wares in the streets, rag-picking, and
filth-gathering in general, are their means of earning a
livelihood.</p>
<p>The venerated names of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, are almost
needless, or seldom heard&mdash;for the one comprehensive word Yahoudy
(Jew) is the nomenclature <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href=
"#pb377" name="pb377">377</a>]</span>of the whole remnant of the chosen
people. Yahoudy come, and Yahoudy go, are the summons and
dismissal&mdash;while the rabble boys mockingly shout <i>Tchefut</i>,
and snatch some fragment of their tattered garments.</p>
<p>Public sentiment having stigmatized them as utterly depraved, they
have no incentive to honesty, and not daring enough to commit any
atrocious crime, they become more expert in petty larcenies and like
misdemeanors. They are even accused of stealing a Christian child once
a year, in order to mingle its blood in their festivals, as a
retaliation upon the Christians in general.</p>
<p>This, of course, refers to the mass, who, victims as they are to
misery of all sorts, cannot be expected to practice the kindlier
virtues which distinguish those among them to whom a better fate has
been allotted.</p>
<p>There was a celebrated Armenian banker, Tcharazly, who, having
fallen under the displeasure of a certain Turkish grandee, was suddenly
one day seized and hung before the door of his own dwelling; his
property confiscated, and his only son cast into prison.</p>
<p>A certain Jewish banker, Shabgee by name, had long been the friend
and neighbor of this family; and now, in the time of their trouble, he
spared nothing for the liberation of the unfortunate young man,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name=
"pb378">378</a>]</span>the son of his friend; which, he not only
succeeded in obtaining, but reinstated him in all the honors of which
he was the lawful heir.</p>
<p>The Jews are to be found in many villages on the Bosphorus, though
their principal quarter is at Balat, on the Golden Horn. They live also
in other parts of the city, but as may naturally be inferred, in such
places as no one else would inhabit.</p>
<p>Their houses are like bee-hives, literally swarming with human life;
even one single room serves for the only home of several
families&mdash;and the streets of their quarters are almost impassable,
from the collection of garbage and all sorts of refuse, which are
indiscriminately thrown from the windows of their dwellings. Their
misery may partly be attributed to their practice of very early
marriages, as before a man is twenty-one years of age he is burdened
with the care and support of a numerous family, which reduces him to
such poverty, that even the meanest economy can scarcely enable him to
support his own existence and that of the helpless beings dependent on
him. The exactions of the <i>Khakhams</i> or priests, which are very
great, help also to impoverish this pitiable people. It is no wonder,
then, that they appear in rags and tatters&mdash;and herd together in
styes&mdash;yet it is most amusing to see them on a Jewish Sabbath. The
filthy gabardines which they wore <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379"
href="#pb379" name="pb379">379</a>]</span>in the week, as they
exercised their various callings, being laid aside, and bright and
gaudy finery substituted, in which they strut about the streets,
seeming to be other beings, and to have no relation to the wretches of
yesterday. But, of course, in such a population there will be various
grades of misery, and a few families of wealth are to be found among
them.</p>
<p>They have some of the domestic institutions of the Osmanlis, and the
women wear thick white veils, but without concealing the features, as
in the case of the Turkish ladies. The young virgins are allowed to
wear their hair long and flowing&mdash;but after marriage it is
carefully concealed beneath a towering and cumbersome headgear, which
is a wonderful illustration of the tenacity with which this singular
race adheres to ancient usages. It recalls to mind the days of Pharaoh
and the people of Israel, for the similarity is perfect between their
present head-dress and that of the mummies who have reposed in their
tombs ever since the family of Joseph &ldquo;took their cattle and
their goods, which they had gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into
Egypt, Jacob and all his seed with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were originally from Spain, their language is still a
mongrel dialect of that country.</p>
<p>They are very strict in the observance of their religious rites and
ceremonies&mdash;never transacting any business on the Sabbath, nor
performing any domestic duties. Even their lamps on Sabbath evenings
must be lighted by some one of their Christian neighbors&mdash;and
should a conflagration occur on that day, their helplessness is truly
pitiable, for they will see all their property consumed without making
one effort to save it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href=

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>
<h2 class="main">PERA AND THE PEROTES, OR FRANKS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">At the time that the Turks took Constantinople, there
was a colony of Genoese Venetians established in a suburb of the city,
called Galata, who were allowed to retain this quarter, which occupies
the declivity of the hill with the summit called Pera, where the
European emigrants, attracted by commerce and other motives, as well as
the foreign dignitaries, have ever since continued to reside. The
warehouses of the merchants are at Galata, which is connected with the
city by a floating bridge across the Golden Horn.</p>
<p>A little above Galata, on the Bosphorus, is a Turkish quarter called
Top-han&eacute;, or the department of ordnance, through which access is
usually obtained to Pera. The most busy and varied scene is constantly
presented to the eye at this quay. The graceful cayiks with their
delicately pointed prows lie on all <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb382" href="#pb382" name="pb382">382</a>]</span>sides, some waiting
for the convenience of passengers, and others engaged in disembarking
their living freight. It is wonderful to observe the dexterity of
cayikgees. Now, a single boatman pushes up his slender craft, and
succeeds in gaining just space enough to slip in, so closely packed are
the boats all around. It may be some lonely veiled woman who is safely
landed. Anon arrives the large omnibus cayik, as completely stored with
live stock as the New York avenue cars on a Sunday.</p>
<p>The boatmen vociferate, and shove alongside in spite of all their
competitors; the motley group of passengers, Mussulmans, Armenians,
Greeks, Jews, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name=
"pb383">383</a>]</span>Franks, all huddled together, move not, speak
not, but fasten their eyes upon the shore, with the firm conviction,
that as they were safely landed the day before, they will be equally
successful to-day. A prolonged, shrill musical cry, <i>ya-lu-nuz!</i>
hushes every other sound; there is a simultaneous movement among the
cayiks, a moment&rsquo;s pause in the hurrying crowd on shore, as way
is made for the embassy boat with its gilded prow, flying colors, and
five pair of oars. The Eltchy-Bey! is whispered from ear to ear.</p>
<p>Even the beautiful canopied boat of the sultan sometimes passes this
way; propelled by twenty-eight men, it rapidly glides over the waters,
with the regular music of the plashing oars. The cannon peals forth a
royal salute from the shore, and the landing of Top-han&eacute; resumes
its bustling appearance.</p>
<p>Thousands of men, women, and children, are daily landed here, of
every rank and clime, and doubtless, in each bosom one similar emotion,
for a moment displaces all others: gratitude for the footing gained;
then rushes in the vast tide of human hopes, cares and anxieties. The
platform upon which they step, is wretchedly out of repair; the
<i>keahya</i>, who gains a slender pittance by holding the boats from
which so many are safely landed, is invariably a trembling old man; and
as the crowd necessarily jostle each other, it is astonishing that
there are so few accidents. But <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384"
href="#pb384" name="pb384">384</a>]</span>Oriental self-possession has
its careful measured gait, and it is rarely that any stumble, though
Turkish indifference leaves cracks, crevices, and chasms in yawning
boldness. There is a large open area, just after you land; apparently
Nature&rsquo;s great warehouse, solid ground for a foundation and the
vault of heaven for a roofing. Along the shore lie numberless small
coasters, whose crews and cargoes are alike begrimed with darkness, for
they have come down from the Black Sea to supply the city with
charcoal, the ordinary fuel; and immense piles of wood proclaim the
demolition of forests of trees.</p>
<p>There, too, is a great market place, or rather a centre of
attraction to the venders of various merchandise, whom time and custom
have established in their prerogatives, for there is no building
whatever for the convenience or protection of this sort of commerce.
Here, then, in the open air, are butchers, green-grocers, fishmongers,
bakers, fruiterers, and basket-makers, an epitome of practical life.
But here too, is the mosque, the minar&eacute;, and the fountain,
carrying away in its limped flowing, impurities both spiritual and
physical.</p>
<p>This fountain is a beautiful specimen of Oriental architecture. It
is an edifice about 30 feet square, built of pure white marble. Beneath
the cornice which surrounds the roof is a border of arabesque
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385" name=
"pb385">385</a>]</span>characters, richly gilt, and from each side the
water flows into a marble basin.</p>
<p>Not far from this fountain is a cluster of small shops, for the sale
of Kebabs, tobacco, bonbons, and also many small Kahv&eacute;s.</p>
<p>The Kebabs are small pieces of mutton, passed on iron skewers, and
roasted over fires of ignited charcoal, and, though the establishments
are small, they are constantly filled with groups, who surrounding the
copper dishes, seem to attest the excellence of the viands. After
satisfying the more imperative calls of nature, a visit to the
tetune-gee, or tobacco merchant, is inevitable; for not to mention the
almost hourly use of the far-famed weed, this luxury must always
succeed every other repast. Then a moment of kief at the coffee shop,
the fumes of the chibouque, a sip of mocha&rsquo;s berry, a little
neighborly chit-chat, or it may be a business rendezvous, and you are
ready to proceed up the steep hill to Pera. Some mount their own
horses, which the grooms hold in attendance, others avail themselves of
the more jaded looking animals who are waiting to be hired, and
sometimes the Turkish ladies,&mdash;rather antiquities of the species,
deliberately mount the leather hunch on the Hamal&rsquo;s back, and
they too ride up, while others still are obliged, either from a lack of
a like independence, or other stringent motives, to go on Shank&rsquo;s
mare. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386" name=
"pb386">386</a>]</span>Those who do not ascend the hill, disperse in
various directions through the many narrow by-ways which diverge from
the great area.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Pera</span> is the Elysium of shop-keepers, the
very essence of &agrave; la Franga, the Bey-oghlu or dwelling-place of
Princes, the rendezvous of Ministers Plenipotentiary, Ministers
resident, Consular dignitaries, secretaries of Legations, Dragomans,
Attach&eacute;s, and all the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of society&mdash;a
swarming hive of Diplomacy&mdash;only get inside of the hive, even as
drone, and you are <i lang="fr">comme il faut</i>. There is a certain
imposing, mysterious, impenetrable air about every member of this
<i lang="fr">haute noblesse</i>&mdash;each one is full of importance,
each one is condescending to the other; all are on the <i lang="fr">qui
vive</i> for a stray word, an echo of the all-important diplomatic
measures of their rivals; all are cautious not to betray by look or
action any embryo intrigues or man&oelig;uvres. Thus social intercourse
consists of gracious words, unmeaning civilities, and mutual distrust
and suspicion.</p>
<p>Those who have been born in Pera, and others who have been bred
there, have one and all become so very diplomatic that conversation
ordinarily dwindles into monosyllables, general inquiries after health,
and prognostics of the weather.</p>
<p>The simplest question is regarded by them as an inquisitive
intrusion upon their prerogatives and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb387" href="#pb387" name="pb387">387</a>]</span>peculiar sphere, so
that, not to exceed the bounds of decorum, absolute silence becomes the
only alternative. But when any sudden change takes place in the Turkish
administration, or a new public measure is adopted, there is a jubilee
in this social clique&mdash;for the discussion of the pros and cons,
probabilities and possibilities, are talked over until the original
theme is lost sight of, and all the excitement subsides&mdash;unless
something else turns up at the Porte.</p>
<p>Intermarriage has produced a race of Perotes who never having had
the benefit of finding their proper level by contact with a more
elevated and extended sphere, consider themselves the very salt of
civilization, and are even more afraid than the members of the
Legations themselves, of mingling in general society.</p>
<p>The honorable distinction of being a Perote, does not only depend
upon birth, but a still more essential point is allegiance to the
Catholic religion. For the embassies under whose wings these colonies
first sheltered themselves were the representatives of Catholic
nations. The Oriental principle that religion and nationality are
synonymous, had its effect even on this mongrel race; who, by degrees
came to consider Catholicity as also identical with Europeanism.</p>
<p>Enjoying peculiar immunities as prot&eacute;g&eacute;s of these
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name=
"pb388">388</a>]</span>embassies, in their imagined superiority, as
Catholics, to all around them, they regarded the rest of their fellow
citizens with even greater contempt than the Mohammedans felt towards
the Giavours. This <i lang="fr">soi-disant</i> aristocracy is not
confined to Pera, but is to be found scattered throughout the Levant,
at Smyrna and other commercial ports.</p>
<p>Ignorance of the language of the country where they are born is
considered only a proof of their superiority to the other nations; but
for their ignorance of all languages and miserable mongrel dialect
called <i lang="la">lingua Franca</i>, we can find no excuse either
aristocratic or diplomatic.</p>
<p>This <span lang="la">lingua Franca</span> is a corrupted dialect of
the Greek language, interlarded with French and Italian; and in writing
the Roman characters are substituted for the Hellenic, as being more
distingu&eacute;s. Even family names have been modified so as to ignore
any traces of parentage&mdash;such as Sazan Oghlou into Salsani, and
Zipgy Oghlou into Zipcy, etc.</p>
<p>When the foreign ambassadors first became residents of Pera, as long
ago as the days of Suleyman, they found this mixed people apparently a
connecting link between the East and the West; and being themselves
then ignorant of Oriental peculiarities, and the languages of Stamboul,
they were glad to receive these Perotes as employ&eacute;s, dragomans,
etc. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb389" href="#pb389" name=
"pb389">389</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus, by degrees, they became a sort of necessary evil to the
foreign diplomatists.</p>
<p>Greater familiarity with the country, and still more, a just
appreciation of these aspirants to aristocratic honors and functions,
has, however, of late years, opened the eyes of the foreign
representatives; and each embassy is now furnished with employ&eacute;s
from the home government&mdash;consequently, the <i>Perotes</i> are now
decidedly below par.</p>
<p>Adventurers, who, in their own lands, would never be heard of, in
Pera become the guests of ambassadors and statesmen, and aping the airs
and manners of their distinguished patrons, manage to pass current.
Women at every other word murdering their mother tongues, are
transformed into ladies of quality in the palaces of the
representatives of their respective sovereigns.</p>
<p>But these are trifling matters. The outcasts of European society
here find a safe retreat, and are even protected in their outrages,
while the various prot&eacute;g&eacute;s of the different Legations,
natives and foreigners, constitute a privileged community.</p>
<p>Russia has endeavored to increase her own power by inducing the
rayas to adopt her protection, in order to secure any claims whatever
against either Turks or Christians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most desperate ruffians of Southern Europe <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390" name="pb390">390</a>]</span>are
in Turkey under British, Austrian, French, or Greek protection. The
English give impunity to Ionians and Maltese; Austria has her Croats;
French passports screen a crowd of Levantines, whose professed
attachment to Catholicism is allowed to be the cloak to any knavery;
while Greece and Naples send a contingent whose character may be easily
imagined. While the worst of them have protection for delinquencies,
the whole enjoy immunities of the most unjust kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can only be sued in the consular courts of their own
country. They pay less taxes than their neighbors, and in some places
none at all. They are wholly beyond the jurisdiction of the Porte,
while for all claims on the government, or on Turkish subjects they can
bring into play the whole machinery of their embassy. Each
representative is almost bound to make every private complaint an
affair of state, and, in fact the real or nominal Austrian, Briton, or
Frenchman, practically turns the diplomatists of his sovereign into his
own special attorneys whenever he pleases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This picture is not too highly drawn, and shows that if the
Mussulmans need reforms, the nominal Frank population are in a somewhat
<span class="corr" id="xd25e5987" title=
"Source: similiar">similar</span> category.</p>
<p>The effect which has been produced upon the minds <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href="#pb391" name="pb391">391</a>]</span>of
the Osmanlis by such specimens of civilized Europeans has certainly not
been favorable; and it is to be hoped that more extended intercourse
with Europe will counteract these influences.</p>
<p>The Diplomatic corps and the Perotes, though the Upper Tendom, and
codfish aristocracy of Pera, are by no means the greater part of the
population.</p>
<p>English, Americans, French, Germans, Greeks, Armenians, and even
Moslems, reside there, preferring the bustle and public amusements
which are to be secured, to the quiet atmosphere of Stamboul. The opera
house and the fashionable emporiums of commerce have their attractions.
On a Friday, it is amusing to see the crowds of Turkish women in the
different shops, relentlessly handling the merchandize to the infinite
annoyance of the proprietors themselves, who are not so patient as the
merchants of the Bazaars. Often the most extravagant prices are paid
for trifling articles of luxury, by the Osmanlis of wealth, who, even
in this sort of trade, seem to feel that everything <i lang=
"fr">&agrave; la Franca</i> must cost them dear.</p>
<p>The <i>modistes</i> have grown rich by selling them feathers,
flowers, and haberdashery, and the <i>confiseurs</i> have exchanged
their honeyed stores for bags of Turkish gold. There is a great
fondness for dress in the population of Pera, and the balls, soirees
and reunions are so numerous that many shopkeepers, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name=
"pb392">392</a>]</span>having reaped a rich harvest, have retired from
business. Feast days and holidays, which are so frequent, require their
appropriate garb, and the Carnival, its masquerades and costumes de
bal.</p>
<p>All the people, high and low, are determined to dress well, and
display their toilets, so that the marts of fashion and luxury are
never deserted.</p>
<p>The great rendezvous for these happy souls, when their supremest
efforts in outward adorning are accomplished, is the <i>Grand champ des
Morts</i>. Whither they resort in crowds, and sit among the verdure
that springs from the dust of their ancestors, the white tombstones,
the only records of those who once walked in their midst! Occasional
funeral trains, slowly moving towards the newly opened graves, and the
mournful strains of the requiems of the dead, do not distract the
thoughts of those who are bent in chasing the shadows of Time, even
while the realities of Eternity are passing in review before them, and
the very spectres of the tombs seem ready to burst their cerements, and
start up in mocking derision. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393"

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE ARISTOCRACY AND THE PEOPLE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As in every country there ate two classes, viz., the
aristocracy and the people, so in Turkey, there are the <i>Kibars</i>
and the <i>Nass</i>.</p>
<p>Aristocracy may everywhere be sub-divided into the aristocracies of
birth, of letters, wealth and position.</p>
<p>In Turkey, all hereditary rank is vested solely in the person of the
sultan; titles are conferred at his sovereign will and pleasure, and
they do not descend from father to son.</p>
<p>There is not, therefore, a regular or systematic aristocracy, and
the spirit of democracy is there very evident.</p>
<p>Although the Osmanlis hold all learning in great respect, yet
Turkish literature having hitherto been confined to the Koran and its
commentaries, the aristocracy of letters has consequently been
constituted by the expounders of the faith, who arrogate to themselves
the modest appellative of <i>Ulema</i>, or savans. Nevertheless, the
people have the greatest <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href=
"#pb394" name="pb394">394</a>]</span>reverence and consideration for
<i>Zad&eacute;s</i>, or those who are the descendants of illustrious
and enlightened parents.</p>
<p><i lang="fr">L&rsquo;argent fait tout</i> is known and acknowledged
by all the world; and wealth is everywhere the great highway to power
and distinction; elevating its possessor above the common herd. But the
love of riches usually begets the love of power; for, <i lang=
"fr">N&rsquo;est on que riche, on veut &ecirc;tre grand</i>, this is
most evident in a country where the great tenure by which individual
wealth is preserved and personal respect commanded, is official
authority. Hence no Osmanli is contented, however great his wealth,
without some civil function by which he can avert the overbearing
disposition of his rivals. Indeed, so great is their ambition for
supremacy, that wealth and everything else is but secondary in their
estimation.</p>
<p>Therefore the only aristocracy in Turkey is that of wealth combined
with position.</p>
<p>It is not generally merit that raises a man to power in any part of
the world, but still less in Turkey. No matter what his previous
avocations, or utter ignorance, it is supposed that when Allah, or his
proxy, the Padishah, gives the office, that within the turban of
distinction lie all the sense and wit needed for the post! Hence, what
if the cobbler become the pasha, or the shop-boy Grand Vezir, Allah
Kerim! <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395</a>]</span></p>
<p>This a country where versatility of talent is very remarkable, if
not great depth of genius; for one day a man may be head cook to his
majesty, the next a captain pasha, or minister of finance! Thus are
often realized the tales of the Arabian Nights, and the humblest
subject may dream of greatness, and wake to find himself a Redjal, or
grandee of the realm.</p>
<p>Indeed the only real statesmen and true patriots may be reduced to
few individuals, all told, viz., Reshid, Aali, Fuad, Riza, Rifaat, and
Omer Pashas.</p>
<p>Besides, those who have been long employed as servants of the
palace, or have proved themselves cunning buffoons, or able intriguers,
are rewarded by some official post instead of a royal pension, provided
they are of the Faithful. For elevation to office is the privilege of
the Mussulmans only, who, considering themselves lords of the soil, as
they are the proprietors, are unwilling to consign their rights to
their rayas, on the principle that &ldquo;to the victors belong the
spoils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The very existence of the rayas has rendered the Osmanlis proud and
arrogant in their peculiar right as Mussulmans; and, though holding all
high places themselves, they have been willing to call in the
assistance of their subjects in secondary employments. The rayas thus
employed, are, of course, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb396"
href="#pb396" name="pb396">396</a>]</span>a small proportion of the
whole; to all the rest life dwindles into a tinkering, jobbing
affair.</p>
<p>This mushroom aristocracy, which was formerly ephemeral, like
Jonas&rsquo; gourd, springing suddenly into existence, coming to
maturity in an incredibly short space of time, then perishing ere the
sun of its glory arrived at meridian height, has now, by virtue of the
Tanzimat, which secures the enjoyment of life and property, attained a
sort of permanency.</p>
<p>These officials being originally of the people, it may be supposed,
would feel some sympathy for them; but the moment they come into power,
they become an exclusive class. Because in Turkey the patriarchal idea
that everything belongs to the sovereign, has led them to regard the
government as not made for the people, but the people for the
government; they think, therefore, that all advantages should accrue
not to the governed but to the governing, thus reducing the mass into
the state of individual nonentities, or mere conduits for the resources
of the empire. The persons in authority seek, therefore, only the
prosperity of the government, and constitute, as it were, a sort of
<i>fiscal</i> administration, rather than one mindful of the good of
the commonwealth. Hence, whenever a project of public utility is
proposed, the first idea that crosses the mind of a Turkish
functionary, is what direct advantage may accrue to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name="pb397">397</a>]</span>the
government? With such perverted ideas, the aristocracy, who are termed
par excellence the <i>Kibars</i>, though few in numbers, are like
leaven to the whole mass; domineering, exciting, and often corrupting
the best materials; and as men are creatures of circumstances, their
moral and temporal conditions are but the results of the good or bad
government under which they live. The evils, corruptions, and miseries
existing in a community, are not therefore to be attributed to the mass
<i>indiscriminately</i>, but rather to the influences that surround
them.</p>
<p><i lang="tr">Baluk bashdan Kokar</i> is a common proverb with the
Osmanlis, or as is the fountain so will be the streams which flow from
it; therefore a government which exercises its prerogatives to revenge,
not to punish; to remove the offender, not to benefit others by making
an example of him; to deal death-blows to all who stand in the way; to
encourage self-aggrandizement rather than study the wants of the
community; to prefer the intriguant before the patriot; to patronize
the buffoon rather than the statesman; such a government cannot fail to
stamp its sanguinary and arbitrary character upon its subjects.</p>
<p>A country where the insidious poison is ever at hand, and where the
innocent and new-born infant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href=
"#pb398" name="pb398">398</a>]</span>who may endanger the heirs to the
throne is forced to yield the life it has but just received; in such a
land the same scenes will be enacted in its darkest corners, and the
peasant will mimic the lord as far as he dares.</p>
<p>The selfish and corrupt principles of the government have naturally
had their pernicious effects upon all its agents, and through them,
upon the people.</p>
<p>The sultan is the great sun of the system&mdash;around whom the many
lesser orbs revolve. While the pashas and dignitaries are themselves
planets of no small lustre, attended by innumerable satellites of their
own.</p>
<p>The grandee holds the cable of power upon which tremblingly cling a
numerous train, from its summit to its lowest extremity&mdash;all
sustained, as long as the rope is firm; all crushed, when it slips from
the hand of its supporter.</p>
<p>Indiscriminate patronage being a principle, favoritism and
corruption become of necessity a natural consequence. Indifferent men
are therefore raised to places of trust, to perform duties which can
never occupy their minds or engross their intellect, but the want of
money is their first and their keenest necessity; for
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">N&rsquo;est on que grand? On veut &ecirc;tre
riche. Est on et grand et riche? On veut &ecirc;tre plus grand et plus
riche.</span>&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399"
name="pb399">399</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus all patriotism is subverted&mdash;and individual interest and
position are made the <span lang="la">sine qu&acirc; non</span> of
existence.</p>
<p>Before they were enervated by conquest and the possession of vast
tributary states, which intoxicated them with sudden wealth, the Turks
were brave in battle, faithful to their friends, and generous to their
enemies. But being inured to war and excitement, peace and tranquillity
only reduced them to a state of sloth and idleness, and inspired them
with conceit and arrogance to all around them. Content with being the
lords of the realm, ignorant and unfitted for the arts of peace, all
their affairs were consigned to their rayas.</p>
<p>The titles of Vali, Pasha, Mussellim, etc., were enjoyed by them
while their provinces and Pashaliks were either farmed out to
subordinates or managed by their Armenian sarafs or bankers&mdash;who
received and disbursed their incomes; so that the Osmanli grandee had
nothing to do but lounge listlessly in his Keosk and puff his long
chibouk&mdash;varying his life by occasional official visits to the
Porte, or in the softer seclusion of his harem.</p>
<p>The enviable condition of indolence, and the desire to be surrounded
with the trappings of wealth, created a rivalry among them, not to
attain high and honorable posts as the champions of their
country&rsquo;s welfare, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href=
"#pb400" name="pb400">400</a>]</span>but to ensure the means of luxury
and display&mdash;and to excel each other in supremacy.</p>
<p>Hence they have arrived at the acme of perfection in the arts of
adulation, servility, deceit, and intrigue. Real virtue is of no avail,
where successful vice only is admired, and the most insidious and
faithless ever the favorites of fortune. Indeed, ingratitude is stamped
upon their character, for an Osmanli raised to power, would turn the
enemy even of his patron, should he dare to cross his schemes. This is
so proverbial that they have a saying&mdash;<i lang="tr">Bir Osmanli
bir pir&eacute; itchin koss kodja yorgani yakar!</i> an Osmanli would
burn up an entire coverlet to rid himself of a single flea! or in other
words, no consideration would deter him from any sacrifice that would
promote his own interests&mdash;examples of which are of daily
occurrence in their political machinations.</p>
<p>In such a malarious atmosphere, it would be supposed that every
moral virtue would perish, and only noisome weeds choke the
soil&mdash;but such is by no means the case. As the richest fruits and
most fragrant flowers often grow from the very putrefactions that lie
on the surface of the earth, so the <i>people</i> in Turkey, surrounded
by such a depraved and corrupted court, are themselves often specimens
of nature&rsquo;s best handiwork. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb401"
href="#pb401" name="pb401">401</a>]</span></p>
<p>The native honesty of the Turks is proverbial, and in illustration
thereof the following story has been widely circulated.</p>
<p>An Englishman having landed a cargo of goods at one of the
custom-houses in the East, was unwilling to leave them at the wharf
<i>unguarded</i>; when he was told by the officer, that there was no
need for apprehension, as there was not another <i>Englishman</i>
within fifty miles!</p>
<p>Whatever may be the truth of this statement, it may be observed,
that some of the Osmanlis of the present day have so far advanced in
civilization as to even excel in this respect their present honorable
Allies! For, the idea that to rob the treasury of the sultan is not
defrauding the people, has led the officials into all the wiles of
corruption and systematic cheating&mdash;so that cheating and bribery
may be considered as the corner stones of this vast edifice.</p>
<p>In the purchase of government supplies there is a display of honesty
on the part of the officials, and also of the European merchants, who
endeavor to underbid each other in prices, which may be considered by
an outsider as ruinous, but on the contrary, always proves profitable
to the co-partners in the speculation.</p>
<p>On a certain occasion 780 pieces of cotton cloth <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402" name="pb402">402</a>]</span>were
palmed off upon the government by a European merchant for 78,000
pieces! for which amount the Treasury gave a note.</p>
<p>Such instances are not of rare occurrence, nor confined only to
officials&mdash;they pervade all classes. Hence the scullion cheats the
cook; the cook the steward; the steward the master; the master the
efendy; the efendy the pasha; and the pasha the sultan; and why not?
Where the strife for aggrandizement and power is so great, and the
battle not to the brave and good, but to the wealthy and intriguing,
there is little or no inducement to honesty and good faith.</p>
<p>Russia seems to understand our people better than any other
Europeans, owing perhaps to her natural proximity; also since &ldquo;a
fellow feeling makes us wond&rsquo;rous kind,&rdquo; she knew where to
touch the sensitive Osmanlis, when she provided Prince Menschikoff, on
his late mission to Constantinople, with a surplus fund of 300,000 Paul
Imperials, or over a million of dollars!</p>
<p>It is not, however, only in Turkey that bribery and corruption
prevail&mdash;even Europe, France and England, the very centres of
civilization, have furnished sad examples of personal aggrandizement,
under the garb of patriotism.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is eminently true, that those of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb403" href="#pb403" name=
"pb403">403</a>]</span>people who have retained their primitive
simplicity are truly honest and confiding; while others have become
contaminated by the corruption of the court, and the grasping spirit of
European adventurers.</p>
<p>Many of the peasants remove to the metropolis, with the hope of
bettering their condition. Some of them become <i>hamals</i>, or
porters, <i>Tellaks</i>, or attendants of the baths; <i>cayikjys</i>,
or boatmen, common laborers, venders in general, and others, domestics
in private houses.</p>
<p>A certain Armenian, native of Van, immediately upon his arrival in
Constantinople, was engaged as a scullion.</p>
<p>In course of time, he complained to his companions that he was not
doing a good business on such a salary as he received, and he wondered
at their apparent prosperity.</p>
<p>His simplicity was, of course, ridiculed at first, and through
compassion, he was initiated into the tricks of the trade. He was told
that he must always add to his account the customary <i>Khamin</i> of
20 or 30 per cent., a technical term, expressing overcharge, or
cheating, not understood by novices.</p>
<p>So the next day, when this simple son of Armenia presented his
account to his master, at the foot of the bill there was an item, which
seemed not quite intelligible to him. He therefore called for an
explanation; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404" name=
"pb404">404</a>]</span>when the servant, in all his native simplicity,
informed him that, <i>that item</i> was the Khamin, or the <span class=
"corr" id="xd25e6189" title="Source: som">sum</span> total of his
cheating, which his companions assured him was customary, and allowed
to all servants in their daily purchases! How fortunate and consoling
it would be, if, instead of being drugged in small doses, we could thus
be informed of the sum total of all the cheatings to which we are
subjected!</p>
<p>The most unlimited confidence is stamped upon all their reciprocal
transactions, and they intrust each other with any amount of goods,
without demanding a receipt, check, or counter check. In the exercise
of their avocation as hamals, they are often intrusted with bags of
money untold; they are generally the watchmen or guardians to the
stores and mercantile houses of the Franks, and in any deficiency or
robbery, their character and integrity are never questioned or
suspected.</p>
<p>The Osmanlis possess the domestic virtues of kindness and affection
in a remarkable degree; their love of offspring is very great, and
their patient endurance of the whims and caprices of their women quite
exemplary.</p>
<p><i>Merhamet</i>, or compassion, is an essential component in their
character, and induces them to extend a most unlimited patronage even
to the lower orders <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405"
name="pb405">405</a>]</span>of creation. Hence the streets in Turkey
swarm with dogs, the roofs of the houses with cats, and the domes of
the mosques with venerated pigeons, which, one and all, are objects of
special charity.</p>
<p>The thousands of cayiks that ply up and down the Bosphorus, acting
as aquatic omnibuses, besides their designated load of passengers, make
a point to carry one or more boys <i>gratuitously</i>, as an act of
charity; and how astonished would they be at the cry of &ldquo;cut
behind,&rdquo; which so often greets the ears of beggars in more
eminent Christian lands, who mistaking wishes for horses might
otherwise chance to ride.</p>
<p>Yet a Turk is a singular being, apparently composed of
contrarieties, of savage traits, as well as domestic virtues, and this
contrariety is to be attributed solely to his fanaticism. Social and
humane until you touch his religious prejudices, when he becomes
implacable.</p>
<p>It has been the interest of the clergy to nurture a fanatical
conceit, by which the great principle of human nature,
self-glorification, has well sustained, and the Mussulmans been led to
consider themselves the very salt of the earth, and the rest of the
human family as contemptible Giavours.</p>
<p>Hence they will not honor a Christian with the Mohammedan
salutation, <i lang="tr">Selamin Alek&uuml;m</i>, &ldquo;<span lang=
"la">Pax <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name=
"pb406">406</a>]</span>vobiscum</span>,&rdquo; nor will they observe
any one in the company, until they have looked for a true believer, to
whom, however humble he may be, is offered the Arabic, or orthodox
salutation; and on the Christians present, however great in their own
estimation, will afterwards be bestowed as their due, a simple <i lang=
"tr">Sabahlar-Hayr Olsoon</i>, or good morning, in plain Turkish.</p>
<p>Though they have been subdued into a certain degree of external
deference by the progress of civilization, yet in the exchange of
social etiquettes, there is always a meaning slight cast upon their
unbelieving friends, which is well understood and appreciated among
themselves.</p>
<p>Even the humblest Mohammedan will appropriate to himself the best
position in a public conveyance, or in any promiscuous assembly,
considering himself as fully entitled to such privileges, by the simple
guarantee of his faith, which elevates him above all humanity.</p>
<p>In the medical school, where some of the scholars belong to the
families of the rayas, this Mussulman conceit is most evident, and even
tolerated and encouraged by the government at the present day; for
regardless of actual merit, it has hitherto been a principle with the
faculty always to place a Mussulman boy at the head of the class!</p>
<p>It may be a matter of wonder to see such bigoted <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407" name=
"pb407">407</a>]</span>characters adopting the very garb of the
contemptible giavours. But the change of costume was effected by the
invincible Mahmoud, who, to liberate his people from the thraldom of
the janissaries, and the superstitions of darker ages, feared neither
priest or Koran, and at all hazards resolved to make a daring stride
towards civilization and reform.</p>
<p>Therefore this change of costume was not effected through any
relaxation of religious bigotry, but by the force of the supreme power
of the sultan; and the Ulema themselves were obliged to compromise, by
wearing a fez, with a simple turban around it, with some other slight
modification of their flowing robes.</p>
<p>Reform in dress having become an essential principle of the
government, those connected with the court and all public officers,
were obliged to conform to the established style, and the young
<i lang="fr">&eacute;l&eacute;gans</i> of Stamboul now vie with the
Parisian exquisites in their recherch&eacute;es toilettes.</p>
<p>But beyond the circle of court etiquette and fashion, the artisans
and peasants still preserve all the varieties of costumes identified
with Orientalism.</p>
<p>Religious fanaticism in the East, is not confined to the Mussulmans
alone. It seems to have a universal sway in this climate, pervading
every community.</p>
<p>The Mussulman would feel callous at the sight of the decapitation of
a Christian, and a Christian would <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb408"
href="#pb408" name="pb408">408</a>]</span>experience a secret
exultation at the death of a Mussulman.</p>
<p>Some years ago, I had the misfortune to meet with an accident; my
carriage was lost in the Bosphorus, and my horse and hostler were
drowned. Near the spot of this occurrence, there was a Greek coaster
lying at anchor, and the sailors soon came to my call for assistance;
but perceiving that the drowning man was dressed in Turkish costume,
and taking him for a Mussulman, they instinctively exclaimed,
<span class="trans" title="Tourkos eine, Tourkos eine"><span class=
"Greek" lang="grc">&Tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&rho;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&epsilon;&iota;&nu;&epsilon;,
&Tau;&omicron;&upsilon;&rho;&kappa;&omicron;&sigmaf;
&epsilon;&iota;&nu;&epsilon;</span></span>, he is a Turk, he is a Turk,
left him to his sad fate. It was in vain that I proclaimed that he was
a Greek and co-religionist of their own.</p>
<p>The Mussulman is fanatical, because he has thereby been goaded on to
victory, and attributes all his successes to the banner of the
Prophet&mdash;and the Christian is bigoted, because his religion is the
only thing left him&mdash;his church is the cradle of his
superstitions, and the badge of his nationality.</p>
<p>Even a Turk designates his nationality by his religion; for if you
ask him, Of what nation are you? his answer will invariably be,
<i lang="tr">El-hamd-ullah Mussulmanem</i>, or Thank God I am a
Mussulman.</p>
<p>Indeed, religion in the East is so pre-eminent, that a declaration
of faith is equal to an allegiance of fealty, and the Mohammedan
formula of La-Illah-Illallah, etc., is the only oath of naturalization,
which, if once <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href="#pb409" name=
"pb409">409</a>]</span>pronounced, fully entitles the individual to all
the privileges and immunities of Turkish citizenship.</p>
<p>Neither is there a community of sentiment among the Christians
themselves&mdash;who, all abhorring Islamism, hate none the less each
other through their religious differences.</p>
<p>An Armenian, native of Angora&mdash;whose inhabitants are reputed
for their religious bigotry&mdash;and a Roman Catholic by persuasion,
had occasion to visit Trieste on some commercial business. On his
arrival there, he was asked by the officer of the quarantine what
nation he belonged to! His unsophistical and prompt answer was
&ldquo;Catholic.&rdquo; The officer, somewhat puzzled at this novel
nationality, reminded him that they were also all Catholics there, but
called themselves Austrians or Italians&mdash;now, what is your nation?
thereupon our worthy friend unflinchingly reiterated that he was a
Catholic; nothing else but a Catholic; for they now had, through the
interference of the French Ambassador, a Patriarch of their own, and
were recognized as a nation! meaning a community.</p>
<p>If a Greek mendicant happen to call at your door, and you ask his
co-religionist who it is, his answer will surely be <i>Christianos</i>
or a Christian; but if the applicant for charity should chance to be of
any other creed, his only title would be <i>ztiyanos</i>, or beggar.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410" name=
"pb410">410</a>]</span></p>
<p>Apart from the religious fanaticism, which is universal, the people,
uncontaminated by a depraved and corrupted court&mdash;unlike the
enervated and luxurious Osmanlis of the metropolis, are simple-minded,
brave, robust, temperate, intelligent, active and industrious.</p>
<p>The Mussulmans formerly taught that apostasy should be punished with
death; but now a new system of instruction, on this and other points,
proceeding from supreme authority, is as readily received by the
credulous multitude.</p>
<p>Their bravery has been attested by the late massacre of Sinope, when
one and all preferred death to an ignominious surrender. The events of
the recent war have established the fact, that there are no better
soldiers than the Turks.</p>
<p>We have the testimony of a distinguished American who</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line xd25e6295">&ldquo;Stood</p>
<p class="line">Among them, but not of them.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">He says that &ldquo;we had an agreeable conversation
with General Omar Pasha&rsquo;s staff surgeon&#8202;&hellip;. Among
other things, he said the Turks had long been extremely anxious to
unite with their Allies in a direct assault upon Sebastopol. I was
somewhat surprised at this intimation, knowing their considerate
nature, and general inclination to conservative <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb411" href="#pb411" name=
"pb411">411</a>]</span>views.&rdquo; Yet, notwithstanding, they have
been accused of cowardice for the desertion of the batteries daring the
battle of Balaklava, which could not well have been avoided under the
circumstances. The triumphs of Silistria, Tchetate and Kars, afford
ample refutation of such calumnies.</p>
<p>The Orientals are strong and athletic men, capable of enduring the
greatest bodily fatigue.</p>
<p>The <i>hamals</i> or porters, both Mussulman and Armenian, have been
known to carry on their backs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412"
href="#pb412" name="pb412">412</a>]</span>immense weights; and one of
these Oriental Hercules has been seen carrying, on a wager, a load of
no less than a <i>thousand pounds</i> to a distance of a quarter of a
mile!</p>
<p>The heavier hardens are suspended from long poles, the number of
which increases in proportion to the weight. And when the contents are
of glassware, instead of being marked <i>Fragile</i>, a full size
representation of a bottle is painted upon the package. The ends of
these poles rest on the shoulders of the hamals, and they walk in a
steady and measured soldier-like step. One of them once accidentally
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name=
"pb413">413</a>]</span>slipped and fell, and the end of the pole
striking him on the chest, he became senseless. His companions raised
him up, whilst one of their number stood back to back with the injured
man, and locking his arms within those of his comrade, repeatedly
raised him from the ground, thus expanding the chest, until he
recovered his breath, when, to the astonishment of the bystanders, the
man, after taking one or two long inspirations, smiling at the funny
incident, shouldered his pole and marched on as if nothing had
happened!</p>
<p>These very men live habitually on the simplest diet, consisting of
the coarsest brown bread, in the middle of which they make a cavity,
and fill it with equal proportions of olive oil and molasses, and it is
really a pleasure to see them enjoy their simple meals with a relish
that would kill all dyspepsia doctors from sheer envy.</p>
<p>The native intelligence of the people is evinced by their aptitude
in acquiring the arts of civilized life; for after a residence of a
couple of years in the metropolis, the <i>rudest peasants</i> become
accomplished soldiers and skillful artisans.</p>
<p>The facility with which they have adapted themselves to the European
style of music is very remarkable, and certainly implies much talent or
cleverness. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb414" href="#pb414" name=
"pb414">414</a>]</span></p>
<p>Indeed, many of those who have risen to the higher ranks of society,
evince no signs, in their general deportment, of plebeian origin, save
the peculiar brogue of local rusticity.</p>
<p>Nothing is more erroneous and unjust than the idea that the
Orientals are indolent or inactive.</p>
<p>The <i lang="tr">tabys</i> or gar&ccedil;ons of the Kahv&eacute;s
even excel their Parisian competitors in alertness and general
ubiquity&mdash;serving scores of customers at once with coffee,
chibouk, and narghill&eacute;s.</p>
<p>The boatmen, who transport the pashas and others to their homes,
after the adjourning of the Porte, and closing of the Bazaars, delight
to compete with each other in speed, and linger on their course until
they meet with an antagonist, when the race sometimes extends the whole
length of the Bosphorus.</p>
<p>Their sports and national games, consisting of horsemanship,
wrestling, chasing, cricket, etc, all tend to show their love of
activity.</p>
<p>There is none of the bustle, or American go-a-headism, in the
Oriental character and habits; none of that nervous excitement which
has so much the air of great progress, too often, like the whirlwind
among the natural elements, creating prodigies of human noise and
commotion, which subside and leave no sign; or it may be, only havoc
and destruction. In all the machineries of Eastern life, public or
domestic, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb415" href="#pb415" name=
"pb415">415</a>]</span>steady and quiet perseverance rules the motion,
the oil of gentleness falling drop by drop upon the rolling wheels,
suffices for the friction; while in the land of modern adventure, by
increasing the pressure to a tremendous degree, the whole structure is
often crushed to atoms. This giddy rushing to a certain point is too
apt to wear out human energy, and most surely annihilates
self-possession, which is the keystone to success. Leave then, we say,
the Oriental sometimes to sit amid the fumes of his favorite chibouk;
for while external things are beclouded, often a mighty scheme is in
conception, and the sunshine of matured judgment suddenly bursts upon
the dim atmosphere, in full power and glory, ready to fructify and
yield all manner of increase.</p>
<p>The apparent idleness which some persons have attributed to the
natives of this country, is more the effect of a spirit of resignation
to external circumstances, than of a desire to be unemployed.</p>
<p>Taking for a basis the idea that the interest of the people is but
secondary, and under the pretence of increasing the revenue of the
country, and thus benefiting the state as it were, but with the secret
hope of self-aggrandizement, all advantageous projects are seized upon
by the officials; thus an effectual check is thrown upon all private
and public enterprise.</p>
<p>The writer was the first to propose to the Turkish <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb416" href="#pb416" name=
"pb416">416</a>]</span>government the establishment of a railroad from
the capital to Adrianople. Not succeeding in this, a line of post
coaches was suggested, for which, after great exertion, a Firman was
granted. But no sooner were the advantages of the project understood,
than several persons in authority began to intrigue, until they
succeeded in appropriating the Firman to themselves, which had been
obtained at so much expense and toil by another.</p>
<p>But as usual, it proved to them more ruinous than profitable,
because of the numerous contenders for the <i>spoils</i>.</p>
<p>No internal improvements are dreamt of, and no motive left for
speculation, and as there is no mutual confidence between the
government and the people, the formation of corporate companies, which
require united action, is out of the question, or, if attempted, they
are sure to fall through by official exactions. Thus, a country teeming
with mines and minerals, is left unexplored, and all other internal
resources lie dormant.</p>
<p>Some attempts have of late been made by the government at internal
improvements, such as the post-road from Trebizond to Erzuroum; but the
over-exertions of those intrusted with the work soon exhausted the
appropriations, and the road was but half completed. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb417" href="#pb417" name="pb417">417</a>]</span></p>
<p>The coal mines at Heraclea have shared a <span class="corr" id=
"xd25e6381" title="Source: similiar">similar</span> fate. Indeed, no
undertaking can be prosperous in the lands of the officials&mdash;and
if any such privilege be granted to private individuals, it is
invariably under the patronage of some grandee.</p>
<p>A permission was obtained from government by an individual to light
the streets of Pera. In the course of six months the lamps were
demolished by the citizens, because they were heavily taxed to fill the
pockets of the speculator, without any advantage to
themselves&mdash;the streets for the most part, being as dark as
before.</p>
<p>All innovations are, therefore, in disrepute, not that they are not
appreciated, but because they invariably prove to be mere schemes for
individual advantage, and never <span lang="la">pro bono
publico</span>.</p>
<p>Hence it is also that the streets, even in the metropolis, are ill
paved, filthy, and not lighted&mdash;each person carrying his own
lantern, and getting along as best he can.</p>
<p>Public enterprise being at so low an ebb, a spirit of indifference
pervades the country and if you once pass the aristocracy, the actual
necessities of the community are but few. They have no idea therefore
of bettering their condition. If you offer them any new invention, they
admire its ingenuity, and dryly tell you they have no need of
it&mdash;consequently <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb418" href=
"#pb418" name="pb418">418</a>]</span>there is no need of patent rights
for new inventions.</p>
<p>This indifference is not to be construed into a love of
inactivity&mdash;but is rather the result of selfishness&mdash;each
man&rsquo;s interests being circumscribed by the sphere in which he
moves. In case of any emergency they are most indefatigable and
persevering. It needs only to cite the fact that Pera, one of the
suburbs of the city, has, in the course of twenty years, been destroyed
by fire <i>four</i> times, and entirely rebuilt by native industry.
Indeed, <i>inactivity</i> is against the spirit of the country, for
there, there are no <i>Rentiers</i>&mdash;but every one must have a
calling&mdash;even the sultan is traditionally supposed to belong to
the <i>tooth-pick trade</i>!</p>
<p>Since the abolition of capital and summary punishments and the
monopolies, by the promulgation of of the Tanzimat, which was an
attempt at reformation, not without some beneficial results, a new
impulse has been given to the activity of the population. In a word,
give but the necessary impetus, and as much genuine go-a-headism may be
found in Turkey, as in Yankee-land itself.</p>
<p>With such a population, and so many internal resources, it may be
deemed a matter of wonder that this empire should be in so ruinous a
condition. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb419" href="#pb419" name=

<h2 class="main">THE FUTURE OF TURKEY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The survey that has been taken of the Turkish empire,
political and social, will furnish the component parts of this
wonderful structure of human power and religious fanaticism. Owing to
the remarkable sway attained by the sword of the Prophet, the various
ingredients mingled by the power of conquest, have all been brought
together, like so many antagonistic elements, to be wrought into some
degree of unity of spirit and purpose, and to be rendered subservient
to one great potentate, absolute and despotic.</p>
<p>The dread power of the Turk, ravaging and blood-thirsty, has only of
late years ceased to inspire terror to the world in general, and to
hold in trembling awe the subjects over which it domineered. Suddenly
the dark cloud of barbarism began to disperse from this vast clime of
the Orient, as Mahmoud, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href=
"#pb420" name="pb420">420</a>]</span>seizing the torch of civilization,
scattered the light of science and reform over the land.</p>
<p>Ever since his day, the struggling beams of knowledge and truth have
been casting a mistlike glow over these dominions, sometimes almost
bursting into a blaze of brightness, and again subsiding into the
obscurity of olden times and religions bigotry.</p>
<p>The principles of progress, and the maintenance of ancient and long
established usages were now at war; the former supported by the
semi-enlighted portion of the people, and the latter by the formidable
body of the ulema or the Mohammedan clergy.</p>
<p>The Rayas, or Christian subjects, hitherto quiescent and despairing,
now saw the star of hope and comparative liberty in their horizon, and
were ready to grasp at any straw of deliverance from the storms of
oppression and tyranny. The mass is in commotion&mdash;Mussulman power
trembles at the vision of the emancipation of its victims. Oppressed
and suffering humanity even dares to utter one vast groan, and to raise
a furtive glance towards the glorious temple of liberty, and the
equality of man with man.</p>
<p>Mahmoud, the bold champion of his country, is surrounded by
intrigues, both foreign and domestic, and becomes entangled in the web
of turbulence and opposition, until his soul can endure no longer, and
wings its flight from the terrible field of battle. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name="pb421">421</a>]</span></p>
<p>But the iron gates of barbarism had been unlocked; and even the
extreme youth of the succeeding Sultan, Abd-ul-Medjid, bringing with
him a sort of regency, could not refasten the heavy bolts.</p>
<p>Thus we find this empire only advancing in progress, the more
wonderful since there has been comparatively so little reform in the
actual government. Even the Sultan has abrogated his absolute and
despotic sway; the once powerful viceroy still sits at his right hand,
but no longer unfettered; and the various religious and civil
functionaries, although the same as the creatures of yesterday, are
themselves amenable to the tribunal of justice and reform, where the
spirit of Mahmoud seems to linger as a reproving and condemning
monitor.</p>
<p>The opposing influences to all innovations were strong; the very
soil rank with bigotry, conceit, and prejudice, and the powers in
actual possession of the commonwealth self-willed and cunning. Hitherto
a comparative isolation had created natural walls, within which
despotism had its unmitigated sway. But as distance became annihilated
throughout the world&rsquo;s dominions, as oceans dwindled into lakes,
rivers into little rills, and broad acres into mere pleasure gardens,
before the mighty achievements of modern invention, all natural
barriers disappeared.</p>
<p>As in ancient times the walls of the great city of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422" name=
"pb422">422</a>]</span>Jericho fell at the blast of the trumpets of
Joshua, no sooner did the echoes of the shrill whistle of the mighty
steamship reverberate along the shores and among the seven hills of
Stamboul, than were annihilated the frontiers of a barbarous and
spiritual despotism, in the stronghold of the Mussulmans. Civilization
from Europe was no longer stayed, but boldly stepped into this natural
garden of the world. To stem the current would be to perish in an
overwhelming vortex; and the very government was obliged to conform, to
compromise, and to make treaties of peace with this new element, social
and political progress.</p>
<p>Not only in Turkey, but universally, the spirit of domination has
been pre-eminent, until the march of human improvement awakened the
community to a sense of their own power and individual rights. Thus the
elements of democracy have been arrayed in opposition to the
oppressions of despotism, threatening its utter annihilation, and
forcing the ruling powers to terms of capitulation. The Reformation
checked the authority of the Pope, a charter was granted to the
English, and their colonies in America soon grew to a great and
independent state.</p>
<p>Though the European states cannot boast of that degree of
independence they have ofttimes struggled for, yet their rulers and
potentates have ever <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423"
name="pb423">423</a>]</span>been, and are still, forced to don the
mantle of Liberty, and maintain the guise of Justice in their various
administrations; thus proving the supremacy of the spirit of
democracy.</p>
<p>But despotism, fostered in the bosom of the little dukedom of
Moscow, has maintained its unbroken sway, and spread over the vast
territories now known as the Russian dominions.</p>
<p>It has engulphed Finland, Crimea, Poland, Bessarabia, Circassia,
Georgia and many other provinces, and by its continued and systematic
encroachments upon Turkey, even threatened to overwhelm Europe itself.
Local circumstances have combined to favor her designs, and render her
aggressions successful.</p>
<p>The remarkable spirit of Mohammedan fanaticism led the Turks on to
conquest. The neighboring countries were all subjugated, until the
thirst for war enticed them into Europe, where victory still followed
their banner. But the very nations that they conquered, many of whom
were induced, by force or otherwise, to make their abode in the Turkish
dominions, tended by degrees to undermine their power. With them came
various religions and creeds, conflicting with each other, and creating
the bitterest animosities. Apart from this, the vast extent of their
territories, without any of the modern facilities of intercourse,
rendered the empire unmanageable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb424"
href="#pb424" name="pb424">424</a>]</span>by an unenlightened and
barbarous government. The army was numerous and powerful, but turbulent
and refractory, usurping the power of governing to themselves, as
attests the well known history of the Janissaries, who could only be
subdued by the bold daring of the illustrious Mahmoud. A new army was
organized, on European principles, and various civil reforms attempted,
but without any beneficial result; for the neighboring nations,
especially the formidable power of Russia, the inveterate enemy of
Turkey, were anxiously regarding the waning decline of Ottoman
supremacy.</p>
<p>Russia, who never missed an opportunity to expedite the rain of this
rival empire, has at various times waged war upon the most trifling
pretexts. Upon the termination of the Greek insurrection, and
immediately after the destruction of the Janissaries, a most aggressive
and iniquitous war was commenced, in which the European powers acted as
sleeping partners. The Albanian, Servian, Egyptian and K&uuml;rdish
rebellions were each successively instigated by Russian and Austrian
emissaries, or secret agents, until the whole country became the arena
of party intrigue, and the direst confusion, thus realizing the plans
of its enemy, and rendering it an easy prey to Moscovite cunning.</p>
<p>To Europe, now awakened to a sense of her own <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425" name=
"pb425">425</a>]</span>impending danger, the division of Turkey seemed
the only alternative, since that empire showed evident symptoms of
decay and inability to resist so powerful an enemy as Russia.</p>
<p>Reshid Pasha, one of the ablest and oldest statesmen and a true
patriot, was at this time in Europe as representative of the Porte. On
hearing of this proposed division of his country, he hastened home to
offer his counsels to the young sultan who had just ascended the
throne. By his representations and suggestions, his majesty was induced
to issue a proclamation called the Tanzimat, or reformation, by which
it was hoped that the country would be regenerated, and the world
convinced that Turkey could maintain itself.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">THE TANZIMAT.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i>Translated from the Turkish.</i></p>
<p>In the former days of the Ottoman empire, as every one knows, the
glorious precepts of the Koran and the laws of the monarchy were
universally observed; and consequently the empire increased both in
power and size, and all subjects, without exception, attained the
highest degree of ease and prosperity. For one hundred and fifty years
a succession of accidents and of divers causes have put an end to this
obedience to the sacred code of the laws, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb426" href="#pb426" name="pb426">426</a>]</span>and to the rules
which spring from it, and our former power and prosperity have been
changed into weakness and poverty; for an empire loses all stability
when the laws cease to be observed.</p>
<p>These considerations are constantly present to our mind, and from
the day of our accession to the throne, the idea of the public welfare,
the amelioration of the state of the provinces, and condolence with the
people, have been its sole occupations. Now, when we consider the
geographical position of the Ottoman empire, the fertility of the soil,
the aptitude and intelligence of the inhabitants, we are convinced that
by applying ourselves to discover suitable means, the result, which by
the aid of God we hope to attain, may be obtained in the space of a few
years. Thus, then, full of confidence in the Most High, and relying
upon the intercession of our Prophet, we have judged proper to seek by
new institutions to procure for the provinces composing the Ottoman
empire the benefit of a good administration.</p>
<p>These institutions must bear principally upon three points, to wit;
1st. The pledges which insure to our subjects a perfect security of
life, honor and fortune. 2d. A regular mode of assessing and levying
the taxes. 3d. A mode equally regular, for the levy of soldiers, and
the duration of the service. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href=
"#pb427" name="pb427">427</a>]</span></p>
<p>And are not life and honor truly the most precious goods which
exist? What man, however base his situation, if his character adapt him
for violence, could be prevented from having recourse to it, and thus
doing injury to his government and the country, if his life and honor
are endangered? If, on the contrary, he enjoys, in this respect, a
perfect security, he will not wander from the paths of loyalty, and all
his acts will concur to the prosperity of the government, and of his
brethren. If his fortune be not secured to him, each remains cold to
the voice of the prince and the country; no one is occupied with the
progress of public fortune, absorbed as every one must be in his own
inquietudes. But if, on the other hand, the citizen possess in
confidence his property of every kind, then full of ardor in his
business, the circle of which he seeks to enlarge in order to extend
that of his pleasure, he finds each day redoubled in his heart the love
of his prince and country, and devotion to her cause; these sentiments
become in him the source of the most praiseworthy actions.</p>
<p>As to the regular assessment and establishment of the taxes, it is
very important that this matter should be regulated, for the State that
is driven to various expenses for the defense of its territory, can
procure the money necessary for its armies and other services only by
the contributions levied upon the subjects. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href="#pb428" name=
"pb428">428</a>]</span>Although, thanks be to God, those of our empire
have for some time been delivered from the scourge of monopolies,
improperly regarded in former times as a source of revenue, an
injurious custom still exists, and which cannot but have disastrous
consequences, I mean that practice of venal concession known as the
Iltizam. By this system the civil and financial administration of a
locality is delivered to the arbitration of a single man, and sometimes
to the iron hand of the most violent and base passions, for if this
farmer of the revenue be not good, he will only have regard to his own
advantage.</p>
<p>It is requisite, then, that this time forward each individual of the
Ottoman society be taxed his quota of his established impost, in the
ratio of his fortune and possessions, and nothing farther can be
required of him. Special laws too must fix and limit the expenses of
our armies by sea and land.</p>
<p>Although, as we have said, the defense of our common country is an
important matter, and although it is the duty of all the inhabitants to
furnish soldiers to that effect; laws must now be established to
regulate the proportion that each locality shall furnish upon the
necessity of the moment, and to reduce to four or five years the term
of military service. For it is both acting unjustly, and giving a death
blow to agriculture and industry, to take, without regard to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429" name=
"pb429">429</a>]</span>the respective population of the districts, from
one more, and from another fewer, than they can supply; while it
reduces the soldiers to despair, and contributes to the depopulation of
the country to retain them all their life-time in the service.</p>
<p>To resume, without these different laws, the necessity for which we
have just seen, the empire can possess neither power, riches, happiness
nor tranquillity; while all these blessings may be obtained from the
existence of the new laws. Therefore, from this time forward the cause
of every accused will be publicly judged conformably to our own divine
law, after thorough inquest and examination, and so long as the regular
judgment is not interrupted, no one will be able in secret, or in
public, to put another to death by poison, or any other punishment.</p>
<p>No one will be permitted to attaint the honor of another. Each
individual will possess his property, of every kind, and will dispose
of it with the most entire liberty, without the opposition of any one;
thus, for example, the property of a criminal shall not be confiscated
to his innocent heirs.</p>
<p>These imperial concessions, extending to all our subjects, of
whatever religion or sect they may be, shall by them be enjoyed without
exception. A perfect security is thus granted by us to the inhabitants
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb430" href="#pb430" name=
"pb430">430</a>]</span>of the empire in their lives, honor, and
fortunes, as the sacred text of our law demands.</p>
<p>Upon all other points, as they must be regulated by the agreement of
enlightened opinion, our Council of Justice (augmented by new members
when it shall be necessary), to which will be joined, on certain days
by us appointed, our Ministers and the Notables of the Empire, will
assemble for the purpose of establishing regular laws, for the security
of life and fortune, and the imposition of taxes. In these assemblies
each man will freely express his ideas and give his opinion.</p>
<p>The laws for the regulation of the military service will be fixed by
the military council, to hold its sessions at the Palace of the
Seraskier.</p>
<p>As soon as a law is fixed to be forever available and executory, it
shall be presented to us, and we will give it our sanction, which we
shall write at the head with our own imperial hand.</p>
<p>As the present institutions have for their aim but the establishment
of religion, government, the nation and the empire, we pledge ourselves
to do nothing contrary to them. In pledge of our promise we will, after
having placed them in the hall in which is kept the glorious mantle of
our Prophet, in presence of all the ulema and grandees of the empire,
make oath by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb431" href="#pb431" name=
"pb431">431</a>]</span>the name of God, and afterwards the ulema and
grandees shall also swear. And if, after this, any one among the ulema,
or grandees of the empire, or any other person whatsoever, shall
violate these institutions, he shall undergo, without regard to rank,
consideration, or credit, the penalty annexed to his well-proved crime.
To this effect a penal code will be re-enacted.</p>
<p>As all the functionaries of the empire at the present day receive
suitable salaries, and as the appointments of those, whose duties are
not sufficiently well remunerated as yet, will be regulated, a vigorous
law will be enacted against the traffic of favor and of charges
(richvet), which is reproved by the divine law, and which is one of the
principal causes of the decadence of the empire.</p>
<p>These dispositions, above stated, being an alteration, and a
complete renovation from the ancient usages, this imperial edict will
be published at Constantinople, and in all the other cities of our
empire, and will be communicated officially to all the Ambassadors of
<span class="corr" id="xd25e6524" title=
"Source: frienldy">friendly</span> powers residing at Constantinople,
that they may be witnesses of the alteration in our institutions,
which, if it please God, shall ever endure.</p>
<p>To this may God have us all in his holy and worthy keeping.</p>
<p>May those who are guilty of an act contrary to the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb432" href="#pb432" name=
"pb432">432</a>]</span>present institutions, be the object of divine
malediction, and be forever deprived of every kind of happiness.</p>

<p>This document, which is an official acknowledgment of the existing
evils and corruptions, was read at G&uuml;l-han&eacute;, on the 3d of
November, 1839, with the greatest solemnity, before a vast concourse of
people, and in the presence of the foreign representatives.</p>
<p>In order to commemorate the occasion, and enforce these new
principles, it was proposed to erect a magnificent public monument, the
plans and designs of which were confided to the writer; but before the
foundations could be laid, a complete</p>
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;Change came o&rsquo;er the spirit of their
dreams.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p class="first">The great Napoleon has wisely pronounced that
&ldquo;Constantinople is the key to all Europe, and designed to be the
capital of the world.&rdquo; Turkey may, therefore, be divided and
subdivided, but Constantinople, the great bone of contention, being
indivisible, the <i>partition of Turkey</i> becomes an impossibility,
and political equilibrium will not permit any one power to usurp its
possession.</p>
<p>It was fortunate that it fell accidentally into the hands of the
Turks, who were incapable of availing <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb433" href="#pb433" name="pb433">433</a>]</span>themselves of its
advantages; and for the same reason it is desirable they should retain
it. Hence the maintenance, or diplomatically speaking, the
<i>integrity</i> of Turkey became an essential element in the polity of
Europe.</p>
<p>The proclamation of the above Hatti Sherif, or Royal Edict, was
therefore hailed with general satisfaction by the European states, and
hopes were awakened that the impending danger would be averted by such
an entire change in the administrative government.</p>
<p>But the Turks of the <i lang="fr">ancien r&eacute;gime</i>,
perceiving no threatening attitude in their European neighbors, and
highly offended at the ultra-liberal measures of the reform party, who
even dared to insult their Mussulman prejudices, and coolly inform them
that &ldquo;the council chamber was not a theological school for the
discussion of religious polemics, nor convertible into a mosque,&rdquo;
resolved to resist to the utmost, and re-establish their own party.
They, therefore, in a body, protested to the sultan, who, in such a
dilemma, could do nothing but dismiss the actual ministry, and organize
a new one.</p>
<p>Rendered bold by success, the new ministry, at whose head was placed
Riza Pasha, soon began to adopt fanatical measures, whereby to modify
the Tanzimat, which it did not suit their policy to nullify
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name=
"pb434">434</a>]</span>altogether; for, by it additional security of
life and property was granted even to themselves.</p>
<p>Besides, the lords of the realm, who only existed by the
&ldquo;cohesive power of public plunder,&rdquo; foresaw that the
Tanzimat secured equality of civil and political rights to the
Christians, especially to the Armenians, who, being better educated and
more enlightened than they themselves were, and in fact the ruling
spirits, would soon have preceded them in all the departments, and
taken the lead in the control of the country.</p>
<p>Schemes of oppression were formed to deprive the Rayas of their
newly acquired privileges. Even the external semblance of equality was
no longer tolerated. To distinguish them from the true followers of the
Prophet, their dress being the same, an order was issued, that the
giavours should wear a certain mark on their fesses, a piece of black
tape. Even the grandees of the Christian community were stigmatized by
a mock badge of honor, made of gold, to be also worn on the side of the
fess. They carried their fanaticism so far as even to defy Europe in
the decapitation of Ovagim, an Armenian apostate, who had abjured
Mohammedanism.</p>
<p>Though his life was promised to Lord Stratford, no sooner had the
secretary of legation, Mr. Alison, left the Porte, than the unfortunate
victim was led forth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435"
name="pb435">435</a>]</span>and beheaded. Whatever may have been the
cause of the sudden reversal of their merciful intentions, it is well
known that Prince Handgery, the Russian Dragoman, was also at the
Porte, and did not leave until the consummation of the sentence. His
body was exposed in the streets of Constantinople at Baluk-Bazaar, the
head placed between his legs, as was customary, with the European cap
which he wore, upon it, as an extra insult to all Europe.</p>
<p>The bodies of state criminals were formerly exposed in public for
three days, but the weather being at this time excessively warm, the
late Sheikh-ul-Islam was advised that injurious effects might result
from such a long exposure; who sagely remarked, that &ldquo;the fact
was indeed so, but the sad results would be still more palpably felt
three years hence.&rdquo; Strange to say the prediction has been fully
verified by recent events.</p>
<p>Thus Mussulman fanaticism brought on a retrograde movement, and
threatened the entire ruin of the country; and the rapacious and
ambitious dispositions of those who lived on the fat of the land, by
degrees so consumed its vitality that it justly merited the cognomen of
the <span class="sc">SICK-MAN</span>.</p>
<p>The Eagle and the Vulture were hovering over the expiring empire,
and Humanity and Civilization demanded that it should be watched over,
with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href="#pb436" name=
"pb436">436</a>]</span>hope either of prolonging its existence, or at
least of giving it a decent burial.</p>
<p>Russia and Austria, who thought that the propitious moment had
arrived to pounce upon their victim, resolved to accomplish their own
plans by one sudden and effective coup-de-main, as the insulting
conduct and threatening attitude of their respective emissaries fully
demonstrated.</p>
<p>But their expectations were not to be realized; for, notwithstanding
the corrupt character of those in power, the spirit of regeneration was
not wholly extinct in the country. The liberal party, some of whom had
retired from public life in disgust, and others, who, giving up all
hope of reform, had abandoned their favorite project, and joined the
powers that be, in such an emergency, like true patriots, whose moral
influence had been silently exerted over the people, came to the
rescue; resisting every form of bribery and fearless of menaces, they
boldly took up the gauntlet, and war was declared.</p>
<p>The interests of Europe being involved in the fate of Turkey,
&ldquo;foreign interference&rdquo; became inevitable. Fortunate it is
not only for Turkey, but for Europe in general, that this event
happened at a time when such interference was available, otherwise
Turkey, like Poland, would have been ingulphed by Russia and Austria.
The result is known to the world. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437"

<p><span class="corr" id="xd25e6595" title=
"Source: Athough">Although</span> the battle has been fought, the
Russian bear been driven to his den, and the congress of nations at
Paris has adopted the Osmanlis into their fraternity, still the
&ldquo;Eastern question,&rdquo; or the maintenance of Turkey, as a
barrier between Russian despotism and European liberty, is far from
being settled. For the problem is not solved, in as much as the ways
and means for the future permanence of this empire are not proclaimed
to the world.</p>
<p>Turkey is apparently secured from Russian animosities, but unless
the country be set on a new basis, and rendered capable of maintaining
itself, the future of Turkey will inevitably be only a repetition of
the past, if not indeed far worse.</p>
<p>This difficult subject will, no doubt, engross the wisdom of Europe,
but the present is the moment to be seized, while the indebtedness of
the Osmanlis to their allies is fresh in their memories, and the gates
of their vast empire stand open to civilization and reform.</p>
<p>Will the Allies again content themselves with mere scrolls,
parchments, and state papers like the Tanzimat of 1839? Shall the
patriots of the state again be left subject to the sway of a conceited
bigotry and blind fanaticism? In a word, shall the country be permitted
to feed upon its own vitals until it consumes itself?</p>
<p>The time has arrived when fictitious progress can <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb438" href="#pb438" name="pb438">438</a>]</span>no
longer be tolerated, and a wholesome reaction most take place.</p>
<p>Turkey and its inhabitants have suffered not only from external
aggressions, but internal discord has maintained an empire of
misrule.</p>
<p>Religious animosity and party spirit have reigned supreme. Greeks
and Christians hating each other, Christians denouncing Christians, and
the Grand Mufti pouring out the anathemas of the Prophet upon the whole
host of giavours. Whence then, in such a population, can any unity of
feeling or of action spring? <i lang="la">Amor patri&aelig;</i>,
philanthropy, progress are all merged in sectarianism and the rage for
religious supremacy. Hitherto, Mohammedanism filling the places of
authority, and possessing the only permanent foothold upon the
territory itself, has left the Christian population without incentive
to competition of any sort. Even in the earliest conflicts of
Mohammedanism, three proposals were always made to those whose
territories were invaded&mdash;to join the standard of the Prophet; to
adhere to their own religious tenets as tributaries; or the trial by
combat; thus evincing a wonderful spirit of liberality in a conquering
power, whether the antagonism was that of conquest or propagandism.</p>
<p>Religious toleration was only a wise policy of the Ottoman
government, for as long as the rayas were of various creeds and
conflicting with each other, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439"
href="#pb439" name="pb439">439</a>]</span>Mussulmans were in no danger.
As in union is strength, so in the disunion of the subjects was the
safety of the rulers. The rayas, as has been said, losing their own
nationality in their condition of servitude, clung to the tenets of
their respective creeds, and knew no country, no nationality but that
of religion. In Turkey all classes of Christians and Jews have always
had freedom of religions worship with the free exercise of their
peculiar rites and observances, public and private.</p>
<p>The proof may daily be witnessed in their funeral processions with
torches, crosses, and chanting priests, preceded by kavasses or police
officers, as the pages of the &ldquo;Missionary Herald of the American
Board for Foreign Missions&rdquo; amply testify. Besides it is a well
known fact that all the Christian churches are privileged to hold
vakufs of their own, on the same footing as those of the mosques; the
very existence of so many differing creeds, and their constant free
discussions, is proof of a great degree of religious toleration.</p>
<p>Even the recent war was the result of this tolerance; for it is well
known that the original matter of debate was whether Russia or France,
or, in other words, whether the Greek church or the Catholic should
control the holy places of Jerusalem!</p>
<p>These holy places not only are in the dominions of the Sultan, but
are the objects of religious veneration <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb440" href="#pb440" name="pb440">440</a>]</span>to the Mussulmans
themselves, who reverently style them Coods-u-Sherif, or Holy
Jerusalem; yet with a remarkable spirit of conciliation, their
jurisdiction was conceded to the Christians.</p>
<p>Travellers who have chanced to be in Jerusalem during the
festivities of Easter, may remember, that when the Christians are
quarrelling and contending with each other, the Mussulmans are forced
to interfere to keep peace and tranquillity!</p>
<p>It is true that the Ottoman government has frequently refused
permission to the Christians to erect or repair churches, etc. This,
however, is not from a spirit of intolerance, for it soon was
understood that a liberal sum might be obtained for these privileges,
and the officials could not resist such occasions for increasing their
revenues. The same advantage is taken of the party intrigues, at the
time of the election of the new patriarchs of the Armenians and
Greeks.</p>
<p>In the days of ignorance, this election cost the Armenians 40,000
piasters, but years of experience have raised the value of the
Sultan&rsquo;s sanction to 200,000 piasters, and the Greeks, amongst
whom party strife is far greater, pay between two and three millions
for the installation of their spiritual head.</p>
<p>Hence it is evident that religious toleration is a principle of the
government, and the contrary an incidental abuse for the advantage of
those in power. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb441" href="#pb441"
name="pb441">441</a>]</span>This very abuse has had its origin among
the Christians themselves, who were ready to bribe the ruling power to
any amount, in order to gain their own ends.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Russia has endeavored to mislead the whole world, and
especially the Christian population of Turkey, with the plausible
pretence of a &ldquo;Guarantee of Liberty of Worship to all classes of
Christians in Turkey;&rdquo; while her conduct at home belies her
sincerity.</p>
<p>The cross upon the Armenian church at Odessa was, not long ago,
removed by order of the government, lest the population should be
misled by the impression that the edifice belonged to the established
church. And in the case of intermarriage, the law orders that the
children should invariably be educated in the Russian faith.</p>
<p>The adage &ldquo;nearer the church, farther from God,&rdquo; is
peculiarly applicable to Russia; for we are told by Gibbon, that long
before the Turks were in Constantinople, the Russians made several
attempts to capture this fated city, and were only driven away by the
flood discharged from the batteries. Were the Greeks of that time
Mohammedans, or was there any suffering Christianity, that these
philanthropic Muscovites were impelled to come to the rescue of the
Christian faith?</p>
<p>There are some strange records in history which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb442" href="#pb442" name=
"pb442">442</a>]</span>conflict materially with political hypocrisy!
The fact is, under the pretence of being the champion of the Cross, the
real object of Russia has ever been to avail herself of the existing
religious fanaticism of the East, and by fanning the flames of
Christian ardor, to institute a crusade of the nineteenth century!</p>
<p>Nations are not, however, governed by sympathy, but by interest, and
the Christians have had too bitter experience of Russian protection to
be again caught in the same net.</p>
<p>The Armenians of Erzuroum were induced to emigrate into the Russian
land of Canaan, which, they were assured, flowed with milk and honey;
but when they drank these honeyed waters, they found them only wormwood
and gall, and all who could, eagerly burst their fetters, and returned
to Turkey, preferring Moslem oppression to Moscovite despotism and
systematic serfdom.</p>
<p>The Greeks, who were so clamorous against the Turks, when they
succeeded in obtaining their independence, by raising the standard of
the Cross against the Crescent of the Prophet, showed very little
preference for the Hellenic government, since after a while they
returned by thousands into Turkey!</p>
<p>The effect of Turkish policy has been such, that there is a
prevalent desire among the Rayas to escape from their allegiance to
such a government, and place <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href=
"#pb443" name="pb443">443</a>]</span>themselves under foreign
protection, not from any fear of religious intolerance whatever, but
merely to obtain comparative liberty and justice. Indeed, what
incentive have the people in general, either Turks or Rayas, to
patriotism, or what care they for national prosperity, when they are
forced to regard themselves as mere tenants of their own houses and
lands?</p>
<p>Missak, the late Armenian banker, did not escape into Russia from
any fear of religious oppression, but to avoid the vindictive
persecutions of the Minister of Finance.</p>
<p>It is not, then, religious freedom that the Christians of Turkey
require, but <i>political franchise and unbiased justice</i>.</p>
<p>The past has sadly proved that the Mohammedans are incapable even of
self government, or at best, Mohammedan domination has had a
demoralizing tendency over half, if not the entire population.</p>
<p>Is the country, then to be ruled by the other half of the
inhabitants viz., the Christian population?</p>
<p>This is another impossibility; for this population is like a house
divided against itself, and besides their incapacity in other respects,
they, having so long felt the bitterest animosity towards their
Mussulman masters, would in their turn become even greater oppressors
than the Mohammedans themselves, as was evinced by the conduct of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name=
"pb444">444</a>]</span>Armenians of Erzuroum during the last war with
Russia.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Eastern question&rdquo; is not, however, one of
propagandism, either of Christianity or of Mohammedanism, but demands,
while granting perfect liberty of conscience to all classes, how
political and civil equality may be maintained throughout the Ottoman
dominions. <i>Fusion</i>, then, is the only policy that can resuscitate
the Turkish Empire.</p>
<p>The Tanzimat was the beginning of a reform, but there were no
coercive measures put into play, to overthrow the power of ancient
usages, so that the proclamation soon became almost a dead letter. The
blind bigotry of the people and the absolute power of the heads of
government, imbued as they are with a spirit of favoritism and
corruption, have hitherto excluded the unfortunate subjects of the
sultan from the justice and protection which are the sacred rights of
every son of Adam. There has been no security for property nor any
inducement to honesty in Turkey.</p>
<p>A man has, under the existing laws, every temptation to injure his
neighbor to any extent, and the innocent have no other means of
protecting themselves and their interests, than by resorting to counter
dishonesty. For instance, if a man is unjustly accused of a debt of one
hundred dollars, it would naturally be inferred that he would at once
deny the accusation, and call for proof. But such an honest
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb445" href="#pb445" name=
"pb445">445</a>]</span>procedure would not answer in the Turkish courts
of justice, for it would immediately give the plaintiff the desired
privilege of producing two hired witnesses, by whose testimony the
<span class="corr" id="xd25e6686" title=
"Source: defendent">defendant</span> would, beyond a doubt, be
condemned to pay the pretended debt.</p>
<p>The only alternative, in such instances, is to verify the principle
&ldquo;set a rogue to catch a rogue&rdquo; by acknowledging the debt,
at the same time declaring that it has already been paid; thus the
accuser is deprived of the privilege of suborning witnesses, and the
defendant avails himself of that prerogative.</p>
<p>Therefore the moral sense of the community is corrupted, and
self-preservation impels the people only to strive to excel each other
in roguery. In such a poisoned atmosphere, no salutary influence can be
exercised until the axe is laid at the root of the evil. In order,
then, to give a fresh stamina to this fading empire&mdash;</p>
<p>1. A new and complete code of justice is needed, consistent with
progressive civilization, and suited to the necessities of these
heterogeneous peoples.</p>
<p>2. To overthrow the sceptre of oppressive bigotry, the next thing to
be effected is an entire separation of church and state, so as to
prevent the interference of the ulema in the administration of justice.
Thus also the aristocracy of religion being abolished, the animosity
existing between the Moslems and Christians <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href="#pb446" name="pb446">446</a>]</span>will
be annihilated, and the hitherto excluded portion of the subjects of
the sultan acknowledged as members of the great Ottoman family.</p>
<p>The identity of religious faith and nationality long swayed even the
European states, but in those countries, this idea is now obsolete, and
must of necessity become so in Turkey, since she has entered their
confederacy.</p>
<p>3. A mixed administration must be formed, composed of
representatives of the different communities, and Mussulman supremacy
no longer tolerated. The mutual benefit of this combination is evident;
for while the Christians, in sharing the supreme power, would lose
their former incentives to cunning and self-interest, the Mussulmans,
on their part, would make rapid strides in the true science of
government.</p>
<p>The tenure by which this mutual authority is to be held, must be
supported and confirmed by a superior tribunal, as it were, consisting
of the powers of Europe, who, having constituted themselves the
champions of Turkey, and shed their blood in her defense, are entitled
to become the guardians of her interests, which are, henceforth, so
identified with their own.</p>
<p>4. The resources of the country must be developed, and a system of
internal improvements established, by which the ruinous principle of
centralization will <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb447" href="#pb447"
name="pb447">447</a>]</span>be counteracted, and the beneficial effects
of this regeneration felt in the uttermost corners of the land.</p>
<p>A general and accurate survey of the country is indispensable,
defining the exact boundaries of both public and private lands, and the
idea that the natural treasures of the soil, belonging to individuals,
appertain to the government, must be abandoned. Hitherto much of the
wealth of the country has lain dormant, because there was no incentive
to exploration of any sort.</p>
<p>5. The Vakuf system must be abolished, and the accumulated wealth
devoted to internal improvements, thus depriving the Ulema of their
great arm of power. It is true, the government has in some measure
controlled these revenues, and established a Bureau of all the Vakufs,
called <i lang="tr">Evkaf</i>, but it has never dared to appropriate,
or to touch any portion of this income for its own purposes.</p>
<p>6. Equal taxation should be levied on property, and the tariff
equitably regulated.</p>
<p>7. A limited free press must be established as the only means of
bringing into publicity the corruptions and abuses to which the
officials have hitherto been addicted.</p>
<p>These are the most apparent means of the preservation and
regeneration of Turkey.</p>
<p>Broad principles may be laid as the foundation, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb448" href="#pb448" name="pb448">448</a>]</span>but
the edifice is to be raised and the master builders must not desert
their work. For, unless these salutary reforms are accomplished by the
aid and influence of the European Powers, there is no hope of the
preservation of Turkey, nor is there any security for the peace of all
Europe and the world in general.</p>
<p>The only question is, <i>Can these reformations be effected in
Turkey?</i></p>
<p>The nature of the Mohammedan religion is not essentially in
opposition to reform. Modern times have proved the Koran of a more
elastic nature than was once supposed, as was exemplified in the
establishment of quarantine regulations; when it was pretended, that it
was blasphemous to interfere with the decrees of Allah to protect human
life; but as it was proved that the Koran allowed self-protection, the
measure was sanctioned by the expounders of that sacred book, and
accepted by the Mussulmans.</p>
<p>Apostasy from Islamism was formerly punished with death; but when
Lord Stratford de Redcliffe interfered in behalf of humanity in the
case of poor Ovagim, who was beheaded in 1843, the Koran was found to
be on his side. The same lenity was manifested by the Mohammedans of
Hindoostan, only a few months ago, towards an apostate, on the plea
that the country was now under British jurisdiction. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb449" href="#pb449" name="pb449">449</a>]</span>The
reason is, that the principles of Islamism are so very simple that they
can be adapted to any degree of modification and reform, especially
under the pressure of circumstances&mdash;besides, necessity knows no
law, not even the Koran itself.</p>
<p>But it may be said that the government thus remodelled will no
longer be Turkish or Mohammedan.</p>
<p>Surely the aim of the friends of this falling empire is not to
re-instate a decaying faith, but to enable the Turks and all the
inhabitants of the land, to gird up their strength and stand before the
world a united and powerful people, freed from bigotry and
superstition, a great Ottoman nation.</p>
<p>Turkey has been admitted into the fraternity of Europe; not as a
Mohammedan power, but as one of the powers that rule the earth&rsquo;s
domains.</p>
<p>The sultan has a voice among the potentates of his times&mdash;not
the voice of Mohammed the Prophet, but of the civilized and regenerated
friend of his own people and the world in general.</p>
<p>A new era has dawned upon Mohammedanism; for, if the Christian world
has for the first time received into its confederation an
anti-Christian empire, the Mohammedans, by entering such a
confederation, have also for the first time placed themselves on an
equality with the former Giavours, whom the precepts of the Koran have
proscribed, and doomed to the sword of the Faithful. Here then
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb450" href="#pb450" name=
"pb450">450</a>]</span>is a bold stride beyond the confines of a faith
only suited to barbaric days, and well calculated to sway the minds of
a superstitious multitude on to conquest. As consanguinity with
civilization is strengthened, who can trace the pathway of the
Mussulman nation through the world&rsquo;s history!</p>
<p>The genius of the country and the condition of the people are not in
opposition to the progress of reform.</p>
<p>The past history of this nation has been the progress of
Mohammedanism&mdash;its conquests and its laws. As Moses was both the
spiritual and temporal law-giver to the Jews, so has Mohammed been to
the Turkomans. Such laws suited the exigencies of the times; but the
sword is sheathed, and in its sheath too, must abide the darkness and
barbarity of past ages.</p>
<p>Besides Mohammedanism in Turkey is not the same as in Arabia or
Bokhara, where Imams and priests predominate. The Turkomans had,
previous to embracing Islamism, a civil government of their own; and in
making the Koran the rule of faith and conduct, they never lost the
idea of Sovereignty independent of Religion. Hence the Turkish has
never been like the Papal government, where cardinals and bishops
represent all the departments of the pontifical state. The very
existence of two distinct representatives of the Sultan, the Grand
Vezir and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb451" href="#pb451" name=
"pb451">451</a>]</span>the Sheikh-ul-Islam, are evidences of a
separation of church and state. If the ecclesiastical has hitherto
superseded the civil power, it has been through the superstitions of
the people, and the chicanery of the officials.</p>
<p>The only real union is in the person of the Sultan, who is the proxy
of Allah, and the supreme Ruler of his people. His will and his edicts
are regarded by them with superstitious reverence.</p>
<p>The natural relations of this empire with the rest of the world, as
well as its new ties of consanguinity with civilization, must, of
necessity, bring about a revolution of policy as well as of action.</p>
<p>His majesty has already introduced many measures of
reform&mdash;such as the abolishing of capital punishment&mdash;the
promulgation of a new constitution, with the privilege of free
deliberation in the national councils, etc.; and besides all these, he
has already commenced, even in his own person and household, a
renovation, which is, in reality, only a conformation to the habits of
civilized life. He has become himself a salaried executive, diminished
his own retinue, etc.</p>
<p>The Sultan well understands the imitative nature of his own people,
and is aware that he is the model to the Grand Vezir and the various
Pashas, who, in their turn, are the channels of his majesty&rsquo;s own
movements to the rest of their fellow citizens. Constantinople
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb452" href="#pb452" name=
"pb452">452</a>]</span>is the city where the game is played by high and
low, &ldquo;So does the Grand Mufti.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, the very monkeys of India cannot excel them in their
disposition to imitate each other. For, it is said that a merchant once
carrying a large bale of fesses, or red caps on a speculation, opened
his goods on the way, with the view to examine them; and taking one out
and putting it upon his head laid down to repose a while under a tree.
What was his astonishment on waking, to find his stock of caps had
taken wings. He looked around in dismay, but happening to cast his eyes
upwards, he beheld a whole colony of monkeys each sporting one of his
caps! It seemed a hopeless case to catch each one of them and force him
to surrender the cap. In his anger and bewilderment he seized his cap
and in a passion threw it to the ground; when the whole tribe of these
mimicking creatures of the grove, instinctively, with the same
vehemence, divested themselves of their head-gear!</p>
<p>In imitation of Sultan, Pashas, and Efendi, the people in the East
have already doffed their robes and turbans; and are ready for other
reforms, if derived from the same honored projectors; crosses now adorn
the breasts of statesmen, and his majesty, the Sultan, displays on his
person the insignia of the garter. Indeed much good may be anticipated
from the liberal sentiments and benevolent dispositions of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb453" href="#pb453" name="pb453">453</a>]</span>the
Sultan, were he but rightly advised and sustained in the exercise of
his absolute power; with the requisite protection against inimical
intrigues and aggressions, both foreign and domestic.</p>
<p>Besides, the government itself is already divided into two parties,
the liberal, who are ready to throw off the yoke of ancient prejudices,
and the church party, who not only with a blind zeal, but with hopes of
self-aggrandizement, are resolved to maintain the rule of superstition.
Now as the advancement, the maintenance of the country is dependent on
the one, its retrogradation and downfall involved in the other, so
Europe necessarily holds out its strong arm to the one, and leaves the
other not only unsupported but threatened. The wisest of the Turkish
statesmen are therefore prepared for changes; indeed, they feel
themselves bound to certain compromises with their friends the Allied
Powers, who engaged in the war, as they well know, not with the view to
reinstate Mussulman oppression and bigoted misrule, but to set the
country on a new footing&mdash;by raising the Christian population to a
level with the Mussulman. Considering the almost equal proportion of
the Christians to the Mohammedans, it is but just, there should at
least be an equality of national rights and privileges. For in
civilized countries, even a <span class="sc">MINORITY</span> is
protected and their rights respected; how much more then should this be
the case where there is not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb454" href=
"#pb454" name="pb454">454</a>]</span>only no disproportion in
numbers&mdash;but decided superiority in civilization.</p>
<p>Besides, should the Mohammedans resist the required
concessions&mdash;the great Christian population of Turkey is ready to
join their western <span class="corr" id="xd25e6785" title=
"Source: coreligionists">co-religionists</span> in any movement.
Therefore it is only a wise policy in the Mohammedans, making a virtue
of necessity, to submit to circumstances, rather than by opposing, to
work their own ruin.</p>
<p>The great essential is a community of interest, which has already,
in some cases, produced a legitimate action. The corps of firemen is
composed of both Mussulmans and Christians, who not only unite in a
common effort for mutual good, but call each other brothers, carouse
together, shed their blood in each other&rsquo;s defense, and never
seem to remember their characteristic dissimilarities.</p>
<p>There is already an indisposedness towards the tenacity of religious
fanaticism, which is so hostile to moral and social progress. Many of
the distinguished men of Turkey having resided abroad, and acquired
foreign languages, have imbibed a taste for the literature of Europe. A
familiarity with the works of such authors as Voltaire, Volney, and
Rousseau, has made many of them free-thinkers. Indeed, most of the
younger members of the Porte are men of liberal sentiments.</p>
<p>They pay external deference to the religion of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb455" href="#pb455" name=
"pb455">455</a>]</span>state rather from motives of self-interest than
from any moral conviction.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, some of these very men, so long habituated to power
and the spoils of office, may, under the guise of religious enthusiasm,
become the instigators of opposition through the superstitions of the
multitude.</p>
<p>Hence the gazettes will occasionally report hostile demonstrations,
and even bloodshed; but any attempts at insurrection must prove futile;
for, with the destruction of the Janissaries, the spirit of rebellion
perished in Turkey. Besides, recent events having brought the
superiority and power of Europe within the immediate vision of the
whole population, they have been forced to call to mind their own
proverb, that &ldquo;the elephant is greater than the camel,&rdquo; and
doubtless they will henceforth arrive at a juster appreciation of their
own capabilities.</p>
<p>Much more might be written on so extended a theme as <span class=
"sc">The Sultan and His People</span>, and an abler pen portray the
condition of this interesting Eastern empire, just emerging from
barbarism into civilization. Yet it may be hoped that these humble
efforts will awaken some sympathy in behalf of a country and its
inhabitants, who so much need the interest and assistance of other
lands; at a moment, too, when the question is of <i>life</i> or
<i>death</i>; of free progressive life, under the shelter of the broad
wings of civilization, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb456" href=
"#pb456" name="pb456">456</a>]</span>or of a suffering death within the
claws of the rapacious Vulture of despotism and oppression.</p>
<p>It may be objected that Turkey has been represented
&ldquo;<span lang="fr">en couleur de rose.</span>&rdquo; If that
roseate hue has been given, the odorous flower has been presented with
all its thorns, divested of the verdure which might have concealed
their bristling points.</p>
<p>But the sweetest rose may preserve its pure essence and odor, even
while growing amid wild and poisonous roots; and if the noxious weeds
can be uprooted, Turkey may, with the requisite culture, become one of
the fairest gardens which adorn our beautiful planet.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped, that the morning twilight is already casting its
softening beams over this land of the Orient; and that the noon-tide
glory of the sun of peace and regeneration, will, ere long, irradiate
with its glorious effulgence, this ancient and interesting Empire!</p>

***** This file should be named 54757-h.htm or 54757-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net/ for Project
Gutenberg (This file was produced from images generously
made available by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
